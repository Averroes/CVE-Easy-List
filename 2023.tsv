CVE-2023-0086	2023-01-05	JetWidgets For Elementor	The JetWidgets for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.12. This is due to missing nonce validation on the save() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be used to enable SVG uploads that could make Cross-Site Scripting possible.
CVE-2023-0087	2023-01-05	Swifty Page Manager	The Swifty Page Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘spm_plugin_options_page_tree_max_width’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
CVE-2023-0088	2023-01-05	Swifty Page Manager	The Swifty Page Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several AJAX actions handling page creation and deletion among other things. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

CVE-2023-22451	2023-01-02	Kiwi	Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password can’t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, can’t be a commonly used password, and can’t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen.
CVE-2023-22452	2023-01-02	kenny2automate	kenny2automate is a Discord bot. In the web interface for server settings, form elements were generated with Discord channel IDs as part of input names. Prior to commit a947d7c, no validation was performed to ensure that the channel IDs submitted actually belonged to the server being configured. Thus anyone who has access to the channel ID they wish to change settings for and the server settings panel for any server could change settings for the requested channel no matter which server it belonged to. Commit a947d7c resolves the issue and has been deployed to the official instance of the bot. The only workaround that exists is to disable the web config entirely by changing it to run on localhost. Note that a workaround is only necessary for those who run their own instance of the bot.
CVE-2023-22453	2023-01-05	discourse	Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, the number of times a user posted in an arbitrary topic is exposed to unauthorized users through the `/u/username.json` endpoint. The issue is patched in version 2.8.14 and 3.0.0.beta16. There is no known workaround.
CVE-2023-22454	2023-01-05	discourse	Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, pending post titles can be used for cross-site scripting attacks. Pending posts can be created by unprivileged users when a category has the "require moderator approval of all new topics" setting set. This vulnerability can lead to a full XSS on sites which have modified or disabled Discourse’s default Content Security Policy. A patch is available in versions 2.8.14 and 3.0.0.beta16.
CVE-2023-22455	2023-01-05	discourse	Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, tag descriptions, which can be updated by moderators, can be used for cross-site scripting attacks. This vulnerability can lead to a full XSS on sites which have modified or disabled Discourse’s default Content Security Policy. Versions 2.8.14 and 3.0.0.beta16 contain a patch.
CVE-2023-22456	2023-01-03	viewvc	ViewVC, a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories, as a cross-site scripting vulnerability that affects versions prior to 1.2.2 and 1.1.29. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack vector involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would cause the browser to run unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging to create. Users should update to at least version 1.2.2 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.29 (if they are using a 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, so users of that release lineage should implement a workaround. Users can edit their ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed paths during rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file references to those changed paths, and wrap them with `[format "html"]` and `[end]`. For most users, that means that references to `[changes.path]` will become `[format "html"][changes.path][end]`. (This workaround should be reverted after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else changed path names will be doubly escaped.)
CVE-2023-22457	2023-01-04	application-ckeditor	CKEditor Integration UI adds support for editing wiki pages using CKEditor. Prior to versions 1.64.3,t he `CKEditor.HTMLConverter` document lacked a protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), allowing to execute macros with the rights of the current user. If a privileged user with programming rights was tricked into executing a GET request to this document with certain parameters (e.g., via an image with a corresponding URL embedded in a comment or via a redirect), this would allow arbitrary remote code execution and the attacker could gain rights, access private information or impact the availability of the wiki. The issue has been patched in the CKEditor Integration version 1.64.3. This has also been patched in the version of the CKEditor integration that is bundled starting with XWiki 14.6 RC1. There are no known workarounds for this other than upgrading the CKEditor integration to a fixed version.
CVE-2023-22460	2023-01-04	go-ipld-prime	go-ipld-prime is an implementation of the InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD) spec interfaces, a batteries-included codec implementations of IPLD for CBOR and JSON, and tooling for basic operations on IPLD objects. Encoding data which contains a Bytes kind Node will pass a Bytes token to the JSON encoder which will panic as it doesn't expect to receive Bytes tokens. Such an encode should be treated as an error, as plain JSON should not be able to encode Bytes. This only impacts uses of the `json` codec. `dag-json` is not impacted. Use of `json` as a decoder is not impacted. This issue is fixed in v0.19.0. As a workaround, one may prefer the `dag-json` codec, which has the ability to encode bytes.
CVE-2023-22461	2023-01-04	sanitize-svg	The `sanitize-svg` package, a small SVG sanitizer to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, uses a deny-list-pattern to sanitize SVGs to prevent XSS. In doing so, literal `<script>`-tags and on-event handlers were detected in versions prior to 0.4.0. As a result, downstream software that relies on `sanitize-svg` and expects resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability was addressed in v0.4.0. There are no known workarounds
CVE-2023-22463	2023-01-04	KubePi	KubePi is a k8s panel. The jwt authentication function of KubePi through version 1.6.2 uses hard-coded Jwtsigkeys, resulting in the same Jwtsigkeys for all online projects. This means that an attacker can forge any jwt token to take over the administrator account of any online project. Furthermore, they may use the administrator to take over the k8s cluster of the target enterprise. `session.go`, the use of hard-coded JwtSigKey, allows an attacker to use this value to forge jwt tokens arbitrarily. The JwtSigKey is confidential and should not be hard-coded in the code. The vulnerability has been fixed in 1.6.3. In the patch, JWT key is specified in app.yml. If the user leaves it blank, a random key will be used. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.
CVE-2023-22464	2023-01-04	viewvc	ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories. Versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.1.30 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack vector involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would cause the browser to run unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging to create. Users should update to at least version 1.2.3 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.30 (if they are using a 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, so users of that release lineage should implement one of the following workarounds. Users can edit their ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed path "copyfrom paths" during rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file references to those changed paths, and wrap them with `[format "html"]` and `[end]`. For most users, that means that references to `[changes.copy_path]` will become `[format "html"][changes.copy_path][end]`. (This workaround should be reverted after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else "copyfrom path" names will be doubly escaped.)
CVE-2023-22465	2023-01-04	http4s	Http4s is a Scala interface for HTTP services. Starting with version 0.1.0 and prior to versions 0.21.34, 0.22.15, 0.23.17, and 1.0.0-M38, the `User-Agent` and `Server` header parsers are susceptible to a fatal error on certain inputs. In http4s, modeled headers are lazily parsed, so this only applies to services that explicitly request these typed headers. Fixes are released in 0.21.34, 0.22.15, 0.23.17, and 1.0.0-M38. As a workaround, use the weakly typed header interface.
CVE-2023-22466	2023-01-04	tokio	Tokio is a runtime for writing applications with Rust. Starting with version 1.7.0 and prior to versions 1.18.4, 1.20.3, and 1.23.1, when configuring a Windows named pipe server, setting `pipe_mode` will reset `reject_remote_clients` to `false`. If the application has previously configured `reject_remote_clients` to `true`, this effectively undoes the configuration. Remote clients may only access the named pipe if the named pipe's associated path is accessible via a publicly shared folder (SMB). Versions 1.23.1, 1.20.3, and 1.18.4 have been patched. The fix will also be present in all releases starting from version 1.24.0. Named pipes were introduced to Tokio in version 1.7.0, so releases older than 1.7.0 are not affected. As a workaround, ensure that `pipe_mode` is set first after initializing a `ServerOptions`.
CVE-2023-22467	2023-01-04	luxon	Luxon is a library for working with dates and times in JavaScript. On the 1.x branch prior to 1.38.1, the 2.x branch prior to 2.5.2, and the 3.x branch on 3.2.1, Luxon's `DateTime.fromRFC2822() has quadratic (N^2) complexity on some specific inputs. This causes a noticeable slowdown for inputs with lengths above 10k characters. Users providing untrusted data to this method are therefore vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. This issue also appears in Moment as CVE-2022-31129. Versions 1.38.1, 2.5.2, and 3.2.1 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, limit the length of the input.
CVE-2023-22472	2023-01-09	security-advisories	Deck is a kanban style organization tool aimed at personal planning and project organization for teams integrated with Nextcloud. It is possible to make a user send any POST request with an arbitrary body given they click on a malicious deep link on a Windows computer. (e.g. in an email, chat link, etc). There are currently no known workarounds. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to 3.6.2.
CVE-2023-22473	2023-01-09	security-advisories	Talk-Android enables users to have video & audio calls through Nextcloud on Android. Due to passcode bypass, an attacker is able to access the user's Nextcloud files and view conversations. To exploit this the attacker needs to have physical access to the target's device. There are currently no known workarounds available. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk Android app is upgraded to 15.0.2.
CVE-2023-22475	2023-01-06	canarytokens	Canarytokens is an open source tool which helps track activity and actions on your network. A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the history page of triggered Canarytokens prior to sha-fb61290. An attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken (a URL) can use this to execute Javascript in the Canarytoken's trigger history page (domain: canarytokens.org) when the history page is later visited by the Canarytoken's creator. This vulnerability could be used to disable or delete the affected Canarytoken, or view its activation history. It might also be used as a stepping stone towards revealing more information about the Canarytoken's creator to the attacker. For example, an attacker could recover the email address tied to the Canarytoken, or place Javascript on the history page that redirect the creator towards an attacker-controlled Canarytoken to show the creator's network location. This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2022-31113, but affected parameters reported differently from the Canarytoken trigger request. An attacker could only act on the discovered Canarytoken. This issue did not expose other Canarytokens or other Canarytoken creators. Canarytokens Docker images sha-fb61290 and later contain a patch for this issue.
CVE-2023-22477	2023-01-09	mercurius	Mercurius is a GraphQL adapter for Fastify. Any users of Mercurius until version 10.5.0 are subjected to a denial of service attack by sending a malformed packet over WebSocket to `/graphql`. This issue was patched in #940. As a workaround, users can disable subscriptions.
CVE-2023-22551	2023-01-01	n/a	The FTP (aka "Implementation of a simple FTP client and server") project through 96c1a35 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by engaging in client activity, such as establishing and then terminating a connection. This occurs because malloc is used but free is not.
CVE-2023-22622	2023-01-04	n/a	WordPress through 6.1.1 depends on unpredictable client visits to cause wp-cron.php execution and the resulting security updates, and the source code describes "the scenario where a site may not receive enough visits to execute scheduled tasks in a timely manner," but neither the installation guide nor the security guide mentions this default behavior, or alerts the user about security risks on installations with very few visits.
CVE-2023-22626	2023-01-05	n/a	PgHero before 3.1.0 allows Information Disclosure via EXPLAIN because query results may be present in an error message. (Depending on database user privileges, this may only be information from the database, or may be information from file contents on the database server.)
CVE-2023-22671	2023-01-06	n/a	Ghidra/RuntimeScripts/Linux/support/launch.sh in NSA Ghidra through 10.2.2 passes user-provided input into eval, leading to command injection when calling analyzeHeadless with untrusted input.

CVE-2022-21652	2022-01-05	shopware	Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform. In affected versions shopware would not invalidate a user session in the event of a password change. With version 5.7.7 the session validation was adjusted, so that sessions created prior to the latest password change of a customer account can't be used to login with said account. This also means, that upon a password change, all existing sessions for a given customer account are automatically considered invalid. There is no workaround for this issue.
CVE-2022-21653	2022-01-05	jawn	Jawn is an open source JSON parser.

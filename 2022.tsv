CVE-2022-0011	2022-02-10	PAN-OS : Prisma Access	PAN-OS software provides options to exclude specific websites from URL category enforcement and those websites are blocked or allowed (depending on your rules) regardless of their associated URL category. This is done by creating a custom URL category list or by using an external dynamic list (EDL) in a URL Filtering profile. When the entries in these lists have a hostname pattern that does not end with a forward slash (/) or a hostname pattern that ends with an asterisk (*), any URL that starts with the specified pattern is considered a match. Entries with a caret (^) at the end of a hostname pattern match any top level domain. This may inadvertently allow or block more URLs than intended and allowing more URLs than intended represents a security risk. For example: example.com will match example.com.website.test example.com.* will match example.com.website.test example.com.^ will match example.com.test You should take special care when using such entries in policy rules that allow traffic. Where possible, use the exact list of hostname names ending with a forward slash (/) instead of using wildcards. PAN-OS 10.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.1.3; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.8; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.12; all PAN-OS 9.0 versions; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.21, and Prisma Access 2.2 and 2.1 versions do not allow customers to change this behavior without changing the URL category list or EDL.

CVE-2022-0018	2022-02-10	GlobalProtect App	An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

A local user could use this flaw to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2.
CVE-2022-0618	2022-03-09	SwiftNIO HTTP2	A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 frame. This vulnerability is caused by a logical error when parsing a HTTP/2 HEADERS or HTTP/2 PUSH_PROMISE frame where the frame contains padding information without any other data. This logical error caused confusion about the size of the frame, leading to a parsing error. This parsing error immediately crashes the entire process. Sending a HEADERS frame or PUSH_PROMISE frame with HTTP/2 padding information does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to send an appropriately crafted frame. The impact on availability is high: receiving the frame immediately crashes the server, dropping all in-flight connections and causing the service to need to restart. It is straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly send appropriately crafted frames, so attackers require very few resources to achieve a substantial denial of service. The attack does not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself: swift-nio-http2 is parsing the frame in memory-safe code, so the crash is safe. However, sudden process crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it is possible that this attack can be used to trigger an error condition that has confidentiality or integrity risks. The risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented from communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to many services. The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to correctly handle the condition. The issue was found by automated fuzzing by oss-fuzz.

CVE-2022-0778	2022-03-15	OpenSSL	The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).

CVE-2022-20001	2022-03-14	fish-shell	fish is a command line shell. fish version 3.1.0 through version 3.3.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution. git repositories can contain per-repository configuration that change the behavior of git, including running arbitrary commands. When using the default configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs `git` commands in order to display information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their current directory into one controlled by the attacker, such as on a shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary commands under the attacker's control. This problem has been fixed in fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in these directories, including using the git tab completion, remains a potential trigger for this issue. As a workaround, remove the `fish_git_prompt` function from the prompt.

CVE-2022-21655	2022-02-22	envoy	Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications.

CVE-2022-21656	2022-02-22	envoy	Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. The default_validator.cc implementation used to implement the default certificate validation routines has a "type confusion" bug when processing subjectAltNames. This processing allows, for example, an rfc822Name or uniformResourceIndicator to be authenticated as a domain name. This confusion allows for the bypassing of nameConstraints, as processed by the underlying OpenSSL/BoringSSL implementation, exposing the possibility of impersonation of arbitrary servers. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted.
CVE-2022-21657	2022-02-22	envoy	Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. In affected versions Envoy does not restrict the set of certificates it accepts from the peer, either as a TLS client or a TLS server, to only those certificates that contain the necessary extendedKeyUsage (id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth, respectively). This means that a peer may present an e-mail certificate (e.g. id-kp-emailProtection), either as a leaf certificate or as a CA in the chain, and it will be accepted for TLS. This is particularly bad when combined with the issue described in pull request #630, in that it allows a Web PKI CA that is intended only for use with S/MIME, and thus exempted from audit or supervision, to issue TLS certificates that will be accepted by Envoy. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted. There are no known workarounds to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.
CVE-2022-21658	2022-01-20	rust	Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.
CVE-2022-21659	2022-01-31	n/a	Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of the Flask web framework. In affected versions there exists a user enumeration vulnerability.

Due to lack of proper sanitization in one of the classes, there's potential for unintended SQL queries to be executed. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.8.3. Older affected versions are also fixed via security release, that go back till 4.1.34. We strongly recommend that you keep auto-updates enabled. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-21666	2022-01-10	USOC	Useful Simple Open-Source CMS (USOC) is a content management system (CMS) for programmers. Versions prior to Pb2.4Bfx3 allowed Sql injection in usersearch.php only for users with administrative privileges. Users should replace the file `admin/pages/useredit.php` with a newer version. USOC version Pb2.4Bfx3 contains a fixed version of `admin/pages/useredit.php`.
CVE-2022-21667	2022-01-07	soketi	soketi is an open-source WebSockets server. There is an unhandled case when reading POST requests which results in the server crashing if it could not read the body of a request. In the event that a POST request is sent to any endpoint of the server with an empty body, even unauthenticated with the Pusher Protocol, it will crash the server. All users that run the server are affected by this vulnerability and it's highly recommended to upgrade to the latest patch. There are no workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-21668	2022-01-10	pipenv	pipenv is a Python development workflow tool. Starting with version 2018.10.9 and prior to version 2022.1.8, a flaw in pipenv's parsing of requirements files allows an attacker to insert a specially crafted string inside a comment anywhere within a requirements.txt file, which will cause victims who use pipenv to install the requirements file to download dependencies from a package index server controlled by the attacker. By embedding malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server, the attacker can trigger arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) on the victims' systems. If an attacker is able to hide a malicious `--index-url` option in a requirements file that a victim installs with pipenv, the attacker can embed arbitrary malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server that will be executed on the victim's host during installation (remote code execution/RCE). When pip installs from a source distribution, any code in the setup.py is executed by the install process. This issue is patched in version 2022.1.8. The GitHub Security Advisory contains more information about this vulnerability.
CVE-2022-21669	2022-01-11	pudding-bot	PuddingBot is a group management bot. In version 0.0.6-b933652 and prior, the bot token is publicly exposed in main.py, making it accessible to malicious actors. The bot token has been revoked and new version is already running on the server. As of time of publication, the maintainers are planning to update code to reflect this change at a later date.
CVE-2022-21670	2022-01-10	markdown-it	markdown-it is a Markdown parser. Prior to version 1.3.2, special patterns with length greater than 50 thousand characterss could slow down the parser significantly. Users should upgrade to version 12.3.2 to receive a patch. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
CVE-2022-21671	2022-01-11	crosis	@replit/crosis is a JavaScript client that speaks Replit's container protocol. A vulnerability that involves exposure of sensitive information exists in versions prior to 7.3.1. When using this library as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in a standalone fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit through a WebSocket, the library will attempt to communicate using a fallback poll-based proxy. The URL of the proxy has changed, so any communication done to the previous URL could potentially reach a server that is outside of Replit's control and the token used to connect to the Repl could be obtained by an attacker, leading to full compromise of that Repl (not of the account). This was patched in version 7.3.1 by updating the address of the fallback WebSocket polling proxy to the new one. As a workaround, a user may specify the new address for the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`) in the `ConnectArgs`. More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
CVE-2022-21672	2022-01-10	make-ca	make-ca is a utility to deliver and manage a complete PKI configuration for workstations and servers. Starting with version 0.9 and prior to version 1.10, make-ca misinterprets Mozilla certdata.txt and treats explicitly untrusted certificates like trusted ones, causing those explicitly untrusted certificates trusted by the system. The explicitly untrusted certificates were used by some CAs already hacked. Hostile attackers may perform a MIM attack exploiting them. Everyone using the affected versions of make-ca should upgrade to make-ca-1.10, and run `make-ca -f -g` as the `root` user to regenerate the trusted store immediately. As a workaround, users may delete the untrusted certificates from /etc/pki/tls and /etc/ssl/certs manually (or by a script), but this is not recommended because the manual changes will be overwritten next time running make-ca to update the trusted anchor.
CVE-2022-21673	2022-01-18	grafana	Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions when a data source has the Forward OAuth Identity feature enabled, sending a query to that datasource with an API token (and no other user credentials) will forward the OAuth Identity of the most recently logged-in user. This can allow API token holders to retrieve data for which they may not have intended access. This attack relies on the Grafana instance having data sources that support the Forward OAuth Identity feature, the Grafana instance having a data source with the Forward OAuth Identity feature toggled on, the Grafana instance having OAuth enabled, and the Grafana instance having usable API keys. This issue has been patched in versions 7.5.13 and 8.3.4.
CVE-2022-21675	2022-01-12	bytecode-viewer	Bytecode Viewer (BCV) is a Java/Android reverse engineering suite. Versions of the package prior to 2.11.0 are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA "Zip Slip"). The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.exe). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including zip, jar, tar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine. The impact of a Zip Slip vulnerability would allow an attacker to create or overwrite existing files on the filesystem. In the context of a web application, a web shell could be placed within the application directory to achieve code execution. All users should upgrade to BCV v2.11.0 when possible to receive a patch. There are no recommended workarounds aside from upgrading.
CVE-2022-21676	2022-01-12	engine.io	Engine.IO is the implementation of transport-based cross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO. A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This impacts all the users of the `engine.io` package starting from version `4.0.0`, including those who uses depending packages like `socket.io`. Versions prior to `4.0.0` are not impacted. A fix has been released for each major branch, namely `4.1.2` for the `4.x.x` branch, `5.2.1` for the `5.x.x` branch, and `6.1.1` for the `6.x.x` branch. There is no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version.
CVE-2022-21677	2022-01-14	discourse	Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Discourse groups can be configured with varying visibility levels for the group as well as the group members. By default, a newly created group has its visibility set to public and the group's members visibility set to public as well. However, a group's visibility and the group's members visibility can be configured such that it is restricted to logged on users, members of the group or staff users. A vulnerability has been discovered in versions prior to 2.7.13 and 2.8.0.beta11 where the group advanced search option does not respect the group's visibility and members visibility level. As such, a group with restricted visibility or members visibility can be revealed through search with the right search option. This issue is patched in `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11 versions of Discourse. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.
CVE-2022-21678	2022-01-13	discourse	Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.0.beta11 in the `tests-passed` branch, version 2.8.0.beta11 in the `beta` branch, and version 2.7.13 in the `stable` branch, the bios of users who made their profiles private were still visible in the `<meta>` tags on their users' pages. The problem is patched in `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `stable` version 2.7.13 of Discourse.
CVE-2022-21679	2022-01-19	istio	Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In Istio 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 The authorization policy with hosts and notHosts might be accidentally bypassed for ALLOW action or rejected unexpectedly for DENY action during the upgrade from 1.11 to 1.12.0/1.12.1. Istio 1.12 supports the hosts and notHosts fields in authorization policy with a new Envoy API shipped with the 1.12 data plane. A bug in the 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 incorrectly uses the new Envoy API with the 1.11 data plane. This will cause the hosts and notHosts fields to be always matched regardless of the actual value of the host header when mixing 1.12.0/1.12.1 control plane and 1.11 data plane. Users are advised to upgrade or to not mix the 1.12.0/1.12.1 control plane with 1.11 data plane if using hosts or notHosts field in authorization policy.
CVE-2022-21680	2022-01-14	marked	Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `block.def` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.
CVE-2022-21681	2022-01-14	marked	Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.
CVE-2022-21682	2022-01-13	flatpak	Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. A path traversal vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to 1.12.3 and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder applies `finish-args` last in the build. At this point the build directory will have the full access that is specified in the manifest, so running `flatpak build` against it will gain those permissions. Normally this will not be done, so this is not problem. However, if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is specified, then flatpak-builder will launch `flatpak build --nofilesystem=host appstream-utils mirror-screenshots` after finalization, which can lead to issues even with the `--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use, the only issue is that these empty directories can be created wherever the user has write permissions. However, a malicious application could replace the `appstream-util` binary and potentially do something more hostile. This has been resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and 1.10.6 by changing the behaviour of `--nofilesystem=home` and `--nofilesystem=host`.
CVE-2022-21683	2022-01-18	wagtail	Wagtail is a Django based content management system focused on flexibility and user experience. When notifications for new replies in comment threads are sent, they are sent to all users who have replied or commented anywhere on the site, rather than only in the relevant threads. This means that a user could listen in to new comment replies on pages they have not have editing access to, as long as they have left a comment or reply somewhere on the site. A patched version has been released as Wagtail 2.15.2, which restores the intended behaviour - to send notifications for new replies to the participants in the active thread only (editing permissions are not considered). New comments can be disabled by setting `WAGTAILADMIN_COMMENTS_ENABLED = False` in the Django settings file.
CVE-2022-21684	2022-01-13	discourse	Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.
CVE-2022-21685	2022-01-14	frontier	Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number `8a93fdc6c9f4eb1d2f2a11b7ff1d12d70bf5a664`, a bug in Frontier's MODEXP precompile implementation can cause an integer underflow in certain conditions. This will cause a node crash for debug builds. For release builds (and production WebAssembly binaries), the impact is limited as it can only cause a normal EVM out-of-gas. Users who do not use MODEXP precompile in their runtime are not impacted. A patch is available in pull request #549.
CVE-2022-21686	2022-01-26	PrestaShop	PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce platform. Starting with version 1.7.0.0 and ending with version 1.7.8.3, an attacker is able to inject twig code inside the back office when using the legacy layout. The problem is fixed in version 1.7.8.3. There are no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-21687	2022-02-01	n/a	gh-ost is a triggerless online schema migration solution for MySQL. Versions prior to 1.1.3 are subject to an arbitrary file read vulnerability. The attacker must have access to the target host or trick an administrator into executing a malicious gh-ost command on a host running gh-ost, plus network access from host running gh-ost to the attack's malicious MySQL server. The `-database` parameter does not properly sanitize user input which can lead to arbitrary file reads.
CVE-2022-21688	2022-01-18	onionshare	OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. Affected versions of the desktop application were found to be vulnerable to denial of service via an undisclosed vulnerability in the QT image parsing. Roughly 20 bytes lead to 2GB memory consumption and this can be triggered multiple times. To be abused, this vulnerability requires rendering in the history tab, so some user interaction is required. An adversary with knowledge of the Onion service address in public mode or with authentication in private mode can perform a Denial of Service attack, which quickly results in out-of-memory for the server. This requires the desktop application with rendered history, therefore the impact is only elevated. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.
CVE-2022-21689	2022-01-18	onionshare	OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions the receive mode limits concurrent uploads to 100 per second and blocks other uploads in the same second, which can be triggered by a simple script. An adversary with access to the receive mode can block file upload for others. There is no way to block this attack in public mode due to the anonymity properties of the tor network.
CVE-2022-21690	2022-01-18	onionshare	OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions The path parameter of the requested URL is not sanitized before being passed to the QT frontend. This path is used in all components for displaying the server access history. This leads to a rendered HTML4 Subset (QT RichText editor) in the Onionshare frontend.
CVE-2022-21691	2022-01-18	onionshare	OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions chat participants can spoof their channel leave message, tricking others into assuming they left the chatroom.
CVE-2022-21692	2022-01-18	onionshare	OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions anyone with access to the chat environment can write messages disguised as another chat participant.
CVE-2022-21693	2022-01-18	onionshare	OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions an adversary with a primitive that allows for filesystem access from the context of the Onionshare process can access sensitive files in the entire user home folder. This could lead to the leaking of sensitive data. Due to the automatic exclusion of hidden folders, the impact is reduced. This can be mitigated by usage of the flatpak release.
CVE-2022-21694	2022-01-18	onionshare	OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. The website mode of the onionshare allows to use a hardened CSP, which will block any scripts and external resources. It is not possible to configure this CSP for individual pages and therefore the security enhancement cannot be used for websites using javascript or external resources like fonts or images.
CVE-2022-21695	2022-01-18	onionshare	OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions authenticated users (or unauthenticated in public mode) can send messages without being visible in the list of chat participants. This issue has been resolved in version 2.5.
CVE-2022-21696	2022-01-18	onionshare	OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions it is possible to change the username to that of another chat participant with an additional space character at the end of the name string. An adversary with access to the chat environment can use the rename feature to impersonate other participants by adding whitespace characters at the end of the username.
CVE-2022-21697	2022-01-25	jupyter-server-proxy	Jupyter Server Proxy is a Jupyter notebook server extension to proxy web services. Versions of Jupyter Server Proxy prior to 3.2.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Any user deploying Jupyter Server or Notebook with jupyter-proxy-server extension enabled is affected. A lack of input validation allows authenticated clients to proxy requests to other hosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check. Because authentication is required, which already grants permissions to make the same requests via kernel or terminal execution, this is considered low to moderate severity. Users may upgrade to version 3.2.1 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, install the patch manually.
CVE-2022-21698	2022-02-15	client_golang	client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.
CVE-2022-21699	2022-01-19	ipython	IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Affected versions are subject to an arbitrary code execution vulnerability achieved by not properly managing cross user temporary files. This vulnerability allows one user to run code as another on the same machine. All users are advised to upgrade.
CVE-2022-21700	2022-01-18	micronaut-core	Micronaut is a JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building JVM web applications with support for Java, Kotlin and the Groovy language. In affected versions sending an invalid Content Type header leads to memory leak in DefaultArgumentConversionContext as this type is erroneously used in static state. ### Impact Sending an invalid Content Type header leads to memory leak in `DefaultArgumentConversionContext` as this type is erroneously used in static state. ### Patches The problem is patched in Micronaut 3.2.7 and above. ### Workarounds The default content type binder can be replaced in an existing Micronaut application to mitigate the issue: ```java package example; import java.util.List; import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Replaces; import io.micronaut.core.convert.ConversionService; import io.micronaut.http.MediaType; import io.micronaut.http.bind.DefaultRequestBinderRegistry; import io.micronaut.http.bind.binders.RequestArgumentBinder; import jakarta.inject.Singleton; @Singleton @Replaces(DefaultRequestBinderRegistry.class) class FixedRequestBinderRegistry extends DefaultRequestBinderRegistry { public FixedRequestBinderRegistry(ConversionService conversionService, List<RequestArgumentBinder> binders) { super(conversionService, binders); } @Override protected void registerDefaultConverters(ConversionService<?> conversionService) { super.registerDefaultConverters(conversionService); conversionService.addConverter(CharSequence.class, MediaType.class, charSequence -> { try { return MediaType.of(charSequence); } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) { return null; } }); } } ``` ### References Commit that introduced the vulnerability https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/commit/b8ec32c311689667c69ae7d9f9c3b3a8abc96fe3 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [Micronaut Core](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues) * Email us at [info@micronaut.io](mailto:info@micronaut.io)
CVE-2022-21701	2022-01-19	istio	Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.
CVE-2022-21702	2022-02-08	grafana	Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions an attacker could serve HTML content thru the Grafana datasource or plugin proxy and trick a user to visit this HTML page using a specially crafted link and execute a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack. The attacker could either compromise an existing datasource for a specific Grafana instance or either set up its own public service and instruct anyone to set it up in their Grafana instance. To be impacted, all of the following must be applicable. For the data source proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based datasource configured with Server as Access Mode and a URL set, the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL of above datasource, and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled data source must be clicked on by an authenticated user. For the plugin proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based app plugin configured and enabled with a URL set, the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL of above app, and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled plugin must be clocked on by an authenticated user. For the backend plugin resource: An attacker must be able to navigate an authenticated user to a compromised plugin through a crafted link. Users are advised to update to a patched version. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
CVE-2022-21703	2022-02-08	grafana	Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Affected versions are subject to a cross site request forgery vulnerability which allows attackers to elevate their privileges by mounting cross-origin attacks against authenticated high-privilege Grafana users (for example, Editors or Admins). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation by tricking an authenticated user into inviting the attacker as a new user with high privileges. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-21704	2022-01-19	log4js-node	log4js-node is a port of log4js to node.js. In affected versions default file permissions for log files created by the file, fileSync and dateFile appenders are world-readable (in unix). This could cause problems if log files contain sensitive information. This would affect any users that have not supplied their own permissions for the files via the mode parameter in the config. Users are advised to update.
CVE-2022-21705	2022-02-23	october	Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In affected versions user input was not properly sanitized before rendering. An authenticated user with the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages can exploit this vulnerability to bypass `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode` in order to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects admin panels that rely on safe mode and restricted permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first have access to the backend area. The issue has been patched in Build 474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10. Users unable to upgrade should apply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe to your installation manually.
CVE-2022-21706	2022-02-25	zulip	Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with topic-based threading. Zulip Server version 2.0.0 and above are vulnerable to insufficient access control with multi-use invitations. A Zulip Server deployment which hosts multiple organizations is vulnerable to an attack where an invitation created in one organization (potentially as a role with elevated permissions) can be used to join any other organization. This bypasses any restrictions on required domains on users' email addresses, may be used to gain access to organizations which are only accessible by invitation, and may be used to gain access with elevated privileges. This issue has been patched in release 4.10. There are no known workarounds for this issue. ### Patches _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_ ### Workarounds _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_ ### References _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_ ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, you can discuss them on the [developer community Zulip server](https://zulip.com/developer-community/), or email the [Zulip security team](mailto:security@zulip.com).
CVE-2022-21707	2022-01-21	wasmcloud-otp	wasmCloud Host Runtime is a server process that securely hosts and provides dispatch for web assembly (WASM) actors and capability providers. In versions prior to 0.52.2 actors can bypass capability authorization. Actors are normally required to declare their capabilities for inbound invocations, but with this vulnerability actor capability claims are not verified upon receiving invocations. This compromises the security model for actors as they can receive unauthorized invocations from linked capability providers. The problem has been patched in versions `0.52.2` and greater.

However, the driver did not verify if the class implements the expected interface before instantiating the class. This can lead to code execution loaded via arbitrary classes. Users using plugins are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-21725	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The estimator for the cost of some convolution operations can be made to execute a division by 0. The function fails to check that the stride argument is strictly positive. Hence, the fix is to add a check for the stride argument to ensure it is valid. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21726	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `Dequantize` does not fully validate the value of `axis` and can result in heap OOB accesses. The `axis` argument can be `-1` (the default value for the optional argument) or any other positive value at most the number of dimensions of the input. Unfortunately, the upper bound is not checked and this results in reading past the end of the array containing the dimensions of the input tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21727	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of shape inference for `Dequantize` is vulnerable to an integer overflow weakness. The `axis` argument can be `-1` (the default value for the optional argument) or any other positive value at most the number of dimensions of the input. Unfortunately, the upper bound is not checked, and, since the code computes `axis + 1`, an attacker can trigger an integer overflow. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21728	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of shape inference for `ReverseSequence` does not fully validate the value of `batch_dim` and can result in a heap OOB read. There is a check to make sure the value of `batch_dim` does not go over the rank of the input, but there is no check for negative values. Negative dimensions are allowed in some cases to mimic Python's negative indexing (i.e., indexing from the end of the array), however if the value is too negative then the implementation of `Dim` would access elements before the start of an array. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21729	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `UnravelIndex` is vulnerable to a division by zero caused by an integer overflow bug.

CVE-2022-21730	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `FractionalAvgPoolGrad` does not consider cases where the input tensors are invalid allowing an attacker to read from outside of bounds of heap. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21731	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of shape inference for `ConcatV2` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack via a segfault caused by a type confusion. The `axis` argument is translated into `concat_dim` in the `ConcatShapeHelper` helper function. Then, a value for `min_rank` is computed based on `concat_dim`. This is then used to validate that the `values` tensor has at least the required rank. However, `WithRankAtLeast` receives the lower bound as a 64-bits value and then compares it against the maximum 32-bits integer value that could be represented. Due to the fact that `min_rank` is a 32-bits value and the value of `axis`, the `rank` argument is a negative value, so the error check is bypassed. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21732	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `ThreadPoolHandle` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by allocating too much memory. This is because the `num_threads` argument is only checked to not be negative, but there is no upper bound on its value. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21733	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `StringNGrams` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by causing an out of memory condition after an integer overflow. We are missing a validation on `pad_witdh` and that result in computing a negative value for `ngram_width` which is later used to allocate parts of the output. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21734	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `MapStage` is vulnerable a `CHECK`-fail if the key tensor is not a scalar. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21735	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `FractionalMaxPool` can be made to crash a TensorFlow process via a division by 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21736	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `SparseTensorSliceDataset` has an undefined behavior: under certain condition it can be made to dereference a `nullptr` value. The 3 input arguments to `SparseTensorSliceDataset` represent a sparse tensor. However, there are some preconditions that these arguments must satisfy but these are not validated in the implementation. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21737	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `*Bincount` operations allows malicious users to cause denial of service by passing in arguments which would trigger a `CHECK`-fail. There are several conditions that the input arguments must satisfy. Some are not caught during shape inference and others are not caught during kernel implementation. This results in `CHECK` failures later when the output tensors get allocated. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21738	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework.

We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21740	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `SparseCountSparseOutput` is vulnerable to a heap overflow. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21741	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. ### Impact An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero in the implementation of depthwise convolutions. The parameters of the convolution can be user controlled and are also used within a division operation to determine the size of the padding that needs to be added before applying the convolution. There is no check before this division that the divisor is strictly positive. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

CVE-2022-23033	2022-01-25	xen	arm: guest_physmap_remove_page not removing the p2m mappings The functions to remove one or more entries from a guest p2m pagetable on Arm (p2m_remove_mapping, guest_physmap_remove_page, and p2m_set_entry with mfn set to INVALID_MFN) do not actually clear the pagetable entry if the entry doesn't have the valid bit set. It is possible to have a valid pagetable entry without the valid bit set when a guest operating system uses set/way cache maintenance instructions. For instance, a guest issuing a set/way cache maintenance instruction, then calling the XENMEM_decrease_reservation hypercall to give back memory pages to Xen, might be able to retain access to those pages even after Xen started reusing them for other purposes.
CVE-2022-23034	2022-01-25	xen	A PV guest could DoS Xen while unmapping a grant To address XSA-380, reference counting was introduced for grant mappings for the case where a PV guest would have the IOMMU enabled. PV guests can request two forms of mappings. When both are in use for any individual mapping, unmapping of such a mapping can be requested in two steps. The reference count for such a mapping would then mistakenly be decremented twice. Underflow of the counters gets detected, resulting in the triggering of a hypervisor bug check.
CVE-2022-23035	2022-01-25	xen	Insufficient cleanup of passed-through device IRQs The management of IRQs associated with physical devices exposed to x86 HVM guests involves an iterative operation in particular when cleaning up after the guest's use of the device. In the case where an interrupt is not quiescent yet at the time this cleanup gets invoked, the cleanup attempt may be scheduled to be retried. When multiple interrupts are involved, this scheduling of a retry may get erroneously skipped. At the same time pointers may get cleared (resulting in a de-reference of NULL) and freed (resulting in a use-after-free), while other code would continue to assume them to be valid.
CVE-2022-23036	2022-03-10		Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations.

CVE-2022-23042	2022-03-10		Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038 gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to revoke access in the rx path. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which can be triggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042

CVE-2022-23302	2022-01-18	Apache Log4j 1.x	JMSSink in all versions of Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration or if the configuration references an LDAP service the attacker has access to. The attacker can provide a TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configuration causing JMSSink to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-4104. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use JMSSink, which is not the default. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.

CVE-2022-23305	2022-01-18	Apache Log4j 1.x 	By design, the JDBCAppender in Log4j 1.2.x accepts an SQL statement as a configuration parameter where the values to be inserted are converters from PatternLayout. The message converter, %m, is likely to always be included. This allows attackers to manipulate the SQL by entering crafted strings into input fields or headers of an application that are logged allowing unintended SQL queries to be executed. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use the JDBCAppender, which is not the default. Beginning in version 2.0-beta8, the JDBCAppender was re-introduced with proper support for parameterized SQL queries and further customization over the columns written to in logs. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.

CVE-2022-23557	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero in `BiasAndClamp` implementation. There is no check that the `bias_size` is non zero. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23558	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause an integer overflow in `TfLiteIntArrayCreate`. The `TfLiteIntArrayGetSizeInBytes` returns an `int` instead of a `size_t. An attacker can control model inputs such that `computed_size` overflows the size of `int` datatype. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23559	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause an integer overflow in embedding lookup operations. Both `embedding_size` and `lookup_size` are products of values provided by the user. Hence, a malicious user could trigger overflows in the multiplication. In certain scenarios, this can then result in heap OOB read/write. Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version.
CVE-2022-23560	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would allow limited reads and writes outside of arrays in TFLite. This exploits missing validation in the conversion from sparse tensors to dense tensors. The fix is included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
CVE-2022-23561	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause a write outside of bounds of an array in TFLite. In fact, the attacker can override the linked list used by the memory allocator. This can be leveraged for an arbitrary write primitive under certain conditions. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23562	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `Range` suffers from integer overflows. These can trigger undefined behavior or, in some scenarios, extremely large allocations. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23563	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
CVE-2022-23564	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding a resource handle tensor from protobuf, a TensorFlow process can encounter cases where a `CHECK` assertion is invalidated based on user controlled arguments. This allows attackers to cause denial of services in TensorFlow processes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23565	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can trigger denial of service via assertion failure by altering a `SavedModel` on disk such that `AttrDef`s of some operation are duplicated. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23566	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow is vulnerable to a heap OOB write in `Grappler`. The `set_output` function writes to an array at the specified index. Hence, this gives a malicious user a write primitive. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23567	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementations of `Sparse*Cwise*` ops are vulnerable to integer overflows. These can be used to trigger large allocations (so, OOM based denial of service) or `CHECK`-fails when building new `TensorShape` objects (so, assert failures based denial of service). We are missing some validation on the shapes of the input tensors as well as directly constructing a large `TensorShape` with user-provided dimensions. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23568	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `AddManySparseToTensorsMap` is vulnerable to an integer overflow which results in a `CHECK`-fail when building new `TensorShape` objects (so, an assert failure based denial of service). We are missing some validation on the shapes of the input tensors as well as directly constructing a large `TensorShape` with user-provided dimensions. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23569	2022-02-03	n/a	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Multiple operations in TensorFlow can be used to trigger a denial of service via `CHECK`-fails (i.e., assertion failures). This is similar to TFSA-2021-198 and has similar fixes. We have patched the reported issues in multiple GitHub commits. It is possible that other similar instances exist in TensorFlow, we will issue fixes as these are discovered. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23570	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding a tensor from protobuf, TensorFlow might do a null-dereference if attributes of some mutable arguments to some operations are missing from the proto. This is guarded by a `DCHECK`. However, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the dereferencing of the null pointer, whereas in the second case it results in a crash due to the assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23571	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding a tensor from protobuf, a TensorFlow process can encounter cases where a `CHECK` assertion is invalidated based on user controlled arguments, if the tensors have an invalid `dtype` and 0 elements or an invalid shape. This allows attackers to cause denial of services in TensorFlow processes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23572	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during shape inference. This case is covered by the `DCHECK` function however, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie` line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains an error `Status`, not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to the assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23573	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `AssignOp` can result in copying uninitialized data to a new tensor. This later results in undefined behavior. The implementation has a check that the left hand side of the assignment is initialized (to minimize number of allocations), but does not check that the right hand side is also initialized. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23574	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. There is a typo in TensorFlow's `SpecializeType` which results in heap OOB read/write. Due to a typo, `arg` is initialized to the `i`th mutable argument in a loop where the loop index is `j`. Hence it is possible to assign to `arg` from outside the vector of arguments. Since this is a mutable proto value, it allows both read and write to outside of bounds data. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23575	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `OpLevelCostEstimator::CalculateTensorSize` is vulnerable to an integer overflow if an attacker can create an operation which would involve a tensor with large enough number of elements. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23576	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `OpLevelCostEstimator::CalculateOutputSize` is vulnerable to an integer overflow if an attacker can create an operation which would involve tensors with large enough number of elements. We can have a large enough number of dimensions in `output_shape.dim()` or just a small number of dimensions being large enough to cause an overflow in the multiplication. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23577	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `GetInitOp` is vulnerable to a crash caused by dereferencing a null pointer.

CVE-2022-23578	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. If a graph node is invalid, TensorFlow can leak memory in the implementation of `ImmutableExecutorState::Initialize`. Here, we set `item->kernel` to `nullptr` but it is a simple `OpKernel*` pointer so the memory that was previously allocated to it would leak. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23579	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The Grappler optimizer in TensorFlow can be used to cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that `SafeToRemoveIdentity` would trigger `CHECK` failures. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23580	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23581	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The Grappler optimizer in TensorFlow can be used to cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that `IsSimplifiableReshape` would trigger `CHECK` failures. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23582	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that `TensorByteSize` would trigger `CHECK` failures. `TensorShape` constructor throws a `CHECK`-fail if shape is partial or has a number of elements that would overflow the size of an `int`. The `PartialTensorShape` constructor instead does not cause a `CHECK`-abort if the shape is partial, which is exactly what this function needs to be able to return `-1`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23583	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that any binary op would trigger `CHECK` failures. This occurs when the protobuf part corresponding to the tensor arguments is modified such that the `dtype` no longer matches the `dtype` expected by the op. In that case, calling the templated binary operator for the binary op would receive corrupted data, due to the type confusion involved. If `Tin` and `Tout` don't match the type of data in `out` and `input_*` tensors then `flat<*>` would interpret it wrongly. In most cases, this would be a silent failure, but we have noticed scenarios where this results in a `CHECK` crash, hence a denial of service. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23584	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user can cause a use after free behavior when decoding PNG images. After `png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode)` gets called, the values of `decode.width` and `decode.height` are in an unspecified state. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23585	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding PNG images TensorFlow can produce a memory leak if the image is invalid. After calling `png::CommonInitDecode(..., &decode)`, the `decode` value contains allocated buffers which can only be freed by calling `png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode)`. However, several error case in the function implementation invoke the `OP_REQUIRES` macro which immediately terminates the execution of the function, without allowing for the memory free to occur. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23586	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that assertions in `function.cc` would be falsified and crash the Python interpreter. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23587	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, Grappler component of TensorFlow is vulnerable to an integer overflow during cost estimation for crop and resize. Since the cropping parameters are user controlled, a malicious person can trigger undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23588	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that Grappler optimizer would attempt to build a tensor using a reference `dtype`. This would result in a crash due to a `CHECK`-fail in the `Tensor` constructor as reference types are not allowed. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23589	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, Grappler component of TensorFlow can trigger a null pointer dereference. There are 2 places where this can occur, for the same malicious alteration of a `SavedModel` file (fixing the first one would trigger the same dereference in the second place). First, during constant folding, the `GraphDef` might not have the required nodes for the binary operation. If a node is missing, the correposning `mul_*child` would be null, and the dereference in the subsequent line would be incorrect. We have a similar issue during `IsIdentityConsumingSwitch`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23590	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A `GraphDef` from a TensorFlow `SavedModel` can be maliciously altered to cause a TensorFlow process to crash due to encountering a `StatusOr` value that is an error and forcibly extracting the value from it. We have patched the issue in multiple GitHub commits and these will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0 and TensorFlow 2.7.1, as both are affected.
CVE-2022-23591	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23592	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow's type inference can cause a heap out of bounds read as the bounds checking is done in a `DCHECK` (which is a no-op during production). An attacker can control the `input_idx` variable such that `ix` would be larger than the number of values in `node_t.args`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.
CVE-2022-23593	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `simplifyBroadcast` function in the MLIR-TFRT infrastructure in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a segfault (hence, denial of service), if called with scalar shapes. If all shapes are scalar, then `maxRank` is 0, so we build an empty `SmallVector`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.
CVE-2022-23594	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The TFG dialect of TensorFlow (MLIR) makes several assumptions about the incoming `GraphDef` before converting it to the MLIR-based dialect. If an attacker changes the `SavedModel` format on disk to invalidate these assumptions and the `GraphDef` is then converted to MLIR-based IR then they can cause a crash in the Python interpreter. Under certain scenarios, heap OOB read/writes are possible. These issues have been discovered via fuzzing and it is possible that more weaknesses exist. We will patch them as they are discovered.
CVE-2022-23595	2022-02-04	tensorflow	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When building an XLA compilation cache, if default settings are used, TensorFlow triggers a null pointer dereference. In the default scenario, all devices are allowed, so `flr->config_proto` is `nullptr`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-23596	2022-02-01	n/a	Junrar is an open source java RAR archive library. In affected versions A carefully crafted RAR archive can trigger an infinite loop while extracting said archive. The impact depends solely on how the application uses the library, and whether files can be provided by malignant users. The problem is patched in 7.4.1. There are no known workarounds and users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
CVE-2022-23597	2022-02-01	n/a	Element Desktop is a Matrix client for desktop platforms with Element Web at its core. Element Desktop before 1.9.7 is vulnerable to a remote program execution bug with user interaction. The exploit is non-trivial and requires clicking on a malicious link, followed by another button click. To the best of our knowledge, the vulnerability has never been exploited in the wild. If you are using Element Desktop < 1.9.7, we recommend upgrading at your earliest convenience. If successfully exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to specify a file path of a binary on the victim's computer which then gets executed. Notably, the attacker does *not* have the ability to specify program arguments. However, in certain unspecified configurations, the attacker may be able to specify an URI instead of a file path which then gets handled using standard platform mechanisms. These may allow exploiting further vulnerabilities in those mechanisms, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
CVE-2022-23598	2022-01-28	laminas-form	laminas-form is a package for validating and displaying simple and complex forms. When rendering validation error messages via the `formElementErrors()` view helper shipped with laminas-form, many messages will contain the submitted value. However, in laminas-form prior to version 3.1.1, the value was not being escaped for HTML contexts, which could potentially lead to a reflected cross-site scripting attack. Versions 3.1.1 and above contain a patch to mitigate the vulnerability. A workaround is available. One may manually place code at the top of a view script where one calls the `formElementErrors()` view helper. More information about this workaround is available on the GitHub Security Advisory.
CVE-2022-23599	2022-01-28	n/a	Products.ATContentTypes are the core content types for Plone 2.1 - 4.3. Versions of Plone that are dependent on Products.ATContentTypes prior to version 3.0.6 are vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version of the image_view_fullscreen page in a cache, for example in Varnish. The technique is known as cache poisoning. Any later visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page. Usually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends on the user's cache settings. Version 3.0.6 of Products.ATContentTypes has been released with a fix. This version works on Plone 5.2, Python 2 only. As a workaround, make sure the image_view_fullscreen page is not stored in the cache. More information about the vulnerability and cvmitigation measures is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
CVE-2022-23600	2022-02-04	fleet	fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.
CVE-2022-23601	2022-02-01	symfony	Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. The Symfony form component provides a CSRF protection mechanism by using a random token injected in the form and using the session to store and control the token submitted by the user. When using the FrameworkBundle, this protection can be enabled or disabled with the configuration. If the configuration is not specified, by default, the mechanism is enabled as long as the session is enabled. In a recent change in the way the configuration is loaded, the default behavior has been dropped and, as a result, the CSRF protection is not enabled in form when not explicitly enabled, which makes the application sensible to CSRF attacks. This issue has been resolved in the patch versions listed and users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23602	2022-02-01	n/a	Nimforum is a lightweight alternative to Discourse written in Nim. In versions prior to 2.2.0 any forum user can create a new thread/post with an include referencing a file local to the host operating system. Nimforum will render the file if able. This can also be done silently by using NimForum's post "preview" endpoint. Even if NimForum is running as a non-critical user, the forum.json secrets can be stolen. Version 2.2.0 of NimForum includes patches for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as is possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23603	2022-02-01	n/a	iTunesRPC-Remastered is a discord rich presence application for use with iTunes & Apple Music. In code before commit 24f43aa user input is not properly sanitized and code injection is possible. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as is possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23604	2022-02-15	x26-Cogs	x26-Cogs is a repository of cogs made by Twentysix for the Red Discord bot. Among these cogs is the Defender cog, a tool for Discord server moderation. A vulnerability in the Defender cog prior to version 1.10.0 allows users with admin privileges to issue commands as other users who share the same server. If a bot owner shares the same server as the attacker, it is possible for the attacker to issue bot-owner restricted commands. The issue has been patched in version 1.10.0. One may unload the Defender cog as a workaround.
CVE-2022-23605	2022-02-04	wire-webapp	Wire webapp is a web client for the wire messaging protocol. In versions prior to 2022-01-27-production.0 expired ephemeral messages were not reliably removed from local chat history of Wire Webapp. In versions before 2022-01-27-production.0 ephemeral messages and assets might still be accessible through the local search functionality. Any attempt to view one of these message in the chat view will then trigger the deletion. This issue only affects locally stored messages. On premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to 2022-01-27-production.0, so that their users are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23606	2022-02-22	envoy	Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.
CVE-2022-23607	2022-02-01	treq	treq is an HTTP library inspired by requests but written on top of Twisted's Agents. Treq's request methods (`treq.get`, `treq.post`, etc.) and `treq.client.HTTPClient` constructor accept cookies as a dictionary. Such cookies are not bound to a single domain, and are therefore sent to *every* domain ("supercookies"). This can potentially cause sensitive information to leak upon an HTTP redirect to a different domain., e.g. should `https://example.com` redirect to `http://cloudstorageprovider.com` the latter will receive the cookie `session`. Treq 2021.1.0 and later bind cookies given to request methods (`treq.request`, `treq.get`, `HTTPClient.request`, `HTTPClient.get`, etc.) to the origin of the *url* parameter. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade Instead of passing a dictionary as the *cookies* argument, pass a `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instance with properly domain- and scheme-scoped cookies in it.
CVE-2022-23608	2022-02-22	pjproject	PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions up to and including 2.11.1 when in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list collision which eventually leading to endless loop. A patch is available in commit db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f which will be included in the next release. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23609	2022-02-04	iTunesRPC-Remastered	iTunesRPC-Remastered is a Discord Rich Presence for iTunes on Windows utility. In affected versions iTunesRPC-Remastered did not properly sanitize user input used to remove files leading to file deletion only limited by the process permissions. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
CVE-2022-23610	2022-03-16	wire-server	wire-server provides back end services for Wire, an open source messenger. In versions of wire-server prior to the 2022-01-27 release, it was possible to craft DSA Signatures to bypass SAML SSO and impersonate any Wire user with SAML credentials. In teams with SAML, but without SCIM, it was possible to create new accounts with fake SAML credentials. Under certain conditions that can be established by an attacker, an upstream library for parsing, rendering, signing, and validating SAML XML data was accepting public keys as trusted that were provided by the attacker in the signature. As a consequence, the attacker could login as any user in any Wire team with SAML SSO enabled. If SCIM was not enabled, the attacker could also create new users with new SAML NameIDs. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to know the SSO login code (distributed to all team members with SAML credentials and visible in the Team Management app), the SAML EntityID identifying the IdP (a URL not considered sensitive, but usually hard to guess, also visible in Team Management), and the SAML NameID of the user (usually an email address or a nick). The issue has been fixed in wire-server `2022-01-27` and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On premise instances of wire-server need to be updated to `2022-01-27`, so that their backends are no longer affected. There are currently no known workarounds. More detailed information about how to reproduce the vulnerability and mitigation strategies is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
CVE-2022-23611	2022-02-04	iTunesRPC-Remastered	iTunesRPC-Remastered is a Discord Rich Presence for iTunes on Windows utility. In affected versions iTunesRPC-Remastered did not properly sanitize image file paths leading to OS level command injection. This issue has been patched in commit cdcd48b. Users are advised to upgrade.
CVE-2022-23612	2022-02-22	openmrs-core	OpenMRS is a patient-based medical record system focusing on giving providers a free customizable electronic medical record system. Affected versions are subject to arbitrary file exfiltration due to failure to sanitize request when satisfying GET requests for `/images` & `/initfilter/scripts`. This can allow an attacker to access any file on a system running OpenMRS that is accessible to the user id OpenMRS is running under. Affected implementations should update to the latest patch version of OpenMRS Core for the minor version they use. These are: 2.1.5, 2.2.1, 2.3.5, 2.4.5 and 2.5.3. As a general rule, this vulnerability is already mitigated by Tomcat's URL normalization in Tomcat 7.0.28+. Users on older versions of Tomcat should consider upgrading their Tomcat instance as well as their OpenMRS instance.
CVE-2022-23613	2022-02-07	xrdp	xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol (RDP) server. In affected versions an integer underflow leading to a heap overflow in the sesman server allows any unauthenticated attacker which is able to locally access a sesman server to execute code as root. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.18.1 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-23614	2022-02-04	Twig	Twig is an open source template language for PHP. When in a sandbox mode, the `arrow` parameter of the `sort` filter must be a closure to avoid attackers being able to run arbitrary PHP functions. In affected versions this constraint was not properly enforced and could lead to code injection of arbitrary PHP code. Patched versions now disallow calling non Closure in the `sort` filter as is the case for some other filters. Users are advised to upgrade.
CVE-2022-23615	2022-02-09	xwiki-platform	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.
CVE-2022-23616	2022-02-09	xwiki-platform	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions it's possible for an unprivileged user to perform a remote code execution by injecting a groovy script in her own profile and by calling the Reset password feature since the feature is performing a save of the user profile with programming rights in the impacted versions of XWiki. The issue has been patched in XWiki 13.1RC1. There are two different possible workarounds, each consisting of modifying the XWiki/ResetPassword page. 1. The Reset password feature can be entirely disabled by deleting the XWiki/ResetPassword page. 2. The script in XWiki/ResetPassword can also be modified or removed: an administrator can replace it with a simple email contact to ask an administrator to reset the password.
CVE-2022-23617	2022-02-09	xwiki-platform	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with edit right can copy the content of a page it does not have access to by using it as template of a new page. This issue has been patched in XWiki 13.2CR1 and 12.10.6. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23618	2022-02-09	xwiki-platform	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions there is no protection against URL redirection to untrusted sites, in particular some well known parameters (xredirect) can be used to perform url redirections. This problem has been patched in XWiki 12.10.7 and XWiki 13.3RC1. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23619	2022-02-09	xwiki-platform	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions it's possible to guess if a user has an account on the wiki by using the "Forgot your password" form, even if the wiki is closed to guest users. This problem has been patched on XWiki 12.10.9, 13.4.1 and 13.6RC1. Users are advised yo update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23620	2022-02-09	xwiki-platform	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions AbstractSxExportURLFactoryActionHandler#processSx does not escape anything from SSX document references when serializing it on filesystem, it is possible to for the HTML export process to contain reference elements containing filesystem syntax like "../", "./". or "/" in general. The referenced elements are not properly escaped. This issue has been resolved in version 13.6-rc-1. This issue can be worked around by limiting or disabling document export.
CVE-2022-23621	2022-02-09	xwiki-platform	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can read any file located in the XWiki WAR (for example xwiki.cfg and xwiki.properties) through XWiki#invokeServletAndReturnAsString as `$xwiki.invokeServletAndReturnAsString("/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg")`. This issue has been patched in XWiki versions 12.10.9, 13.4.3 and 13.7-rc-1. Users are advised to update. The only workaround is to limit SCRIPT right.
CVE-2022-23622	2022-02-09	xwiki-platform	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions there is a cross site scripting (XSS) vector in the `registerinline.vm` template related to the `xredirect` hidden field. This template is only used in the following conditions: 1. The wiki must be open to registration for anyone. 2. The wiki must be closed to view for Guest users or more specifically the XWiki.Registration page must be forbidden in View for guest user. A way to obtain the second condition is when administrators checked the "Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page rights" box in the administration rights. This issue is patched in versions 12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, 13.10.3. There are two main ways for protecting against this vulnerability, the easiest and the best one is by applying a patch in the `registerinline.vm` template, the patch consists in checking the value of the xredirect field to ensure it matches: `<input type="hidden" name="xredirect" value="$escapetool.xml($!request.xredirect)" />`. If for some reason it's not possible to patch this file, another workaround is to ensure "Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page rights" is not checked in the rights and apply a better right scheme using groups and rights on spaces.
CVE-2022-23623	2022-02-07	frourio	Frourio is a full stack framework, for TypeScript. Frourio users who uses frourio version prior to v0.26.0 and integration with class-validator through `validators/` folder are subject to a input validation vulnerability. Validators do not work properly for request bodies and queries in specific situations and some input is not validated at all. Users are advised to update frourio to v0.26.0 or later and to install `class-transformer` and `reflect-metadata`.
CVE-2022-23624	2022-02-07	frourio-express	Frourio-express is a minimal full stack framework, for TypeScript. Frourio-express users who uses frourio-express version prior to v0.26.0 and integration with class-validator through `validators/` folder are subject to a input validation vulnerability.

Users are advised to update frourio to v0.26.0 or later and to install `class-transformer` and `reflect-metadata`.
CVE-2022-23625	2022-03-11	wire-ios	Wire-ios is a messaging application using the wire protocol on apple's ios platform. In versions prior to 3.95 malformed resource identifiers may render the iOS Wire Client completely unusable by causing it to repeatedly crash on launch. These malformed resource identifiers can be generated and sent between Wire users. The root cause lies in [wireapp/wire-ios-transport](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-transport), where code responsible for removing sensible tokens before logging may fail and lead to a crash (Swift exception) of the application. This causes undesirable behavior, however the (greater) Wire system is still functional. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23626	2022-02-08	blog	m1k1o/blog is a lightweight self-hosted facebook-styled PHP blog. Errors from functions `imagecreatefrom*` and `image*` have not been checked properly. Although PHP issued warnings and the upload function returned `false`, the original file (that could contain a malicious payload) was kept on the disk. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23627	2022-02-08	ArchiSteamFarm	ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.
CVE-2022-23628	2022-02-09	opa	OPA is an open source, general-purpose policy engine. Under certain conditions, pretty-printing an abstract syntax tree (AST) that contains synthetic nodes could change the logic of some statements by reordering array literals. Example of policies impacted are those that parse and compare web paths. **All of these** three conditions have to be met to create an adverse effect: 1. An AST of Rego had to be **created programmatically** such that it ends up containing terms without a location (such as wildcard variables). 2. The AST had to be **pretty-printed** using the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/format` package. 3. The result of the pretty-printing had to be **parsed and evaluated again** via an OPA instance using the bundles, or the Golang packages. If any of these three conditions are not met, you are not affected. Notably, all three would be true if using **optimized bundles**, i.e. bundles created with `opa build -O=1` or higher. In that case, the optimizer would fulfil condition (1.), the result of that would be pretty-printed when writing the bundle to disk, fulfilling (2.). When the bundle was then used, we'd satisfy (3.). As a workaround users may disable optimization when creating bundles.
CVE-2022-23630	2022-02-10	gradle	Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. In some cases, Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This occurs when dependency verification is disabled on one or more configurations and those configurations have common dependencies with other configurations that have dependency verification enabled. If the configuration that has dependency verification disabled is resolved first, Gradle does not verify the common dependencies for the configuration that has dependency verification enabled. Gradle 7.4 fixes that issue by validating artifacts at least once if they are present in a resolved configuration that has dependency verification active. For users who cannot update either do not use `ResolutionStrategy.disableDependencyVerification()` and do not use plugins that use that method to disable dependency verification for a single configuration or make sure resolution of configuration that disable that feature do not happen in builds that resolve configuration where the feature is enabled.
CVE-2022-23631	2022-02-09	superjson	superjson is a program to allow JavaScript expressions to be serialized to a superset of JSON. In versions prior to 1.8.1 superjson allows input to run arbitrary code on any server using superjson input without prior authentication or knowledge. The only requirement is that the server implements at least one endpoint which uses superjson during request processing. This has been patched in superjson 1.8.1. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23632	2022-02-17	traefik	Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version 2.6.1, Traefik skips the router transport layer security (TLS) configuration when the host header is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For a request, the TLS configuration choice can be different than the router choice, which implies the use of a wrong TLS configuration. When sending a request using FQDN handled by a router configured with a dedicated TLS configuration, the TLS configuration falls back to the default configuration that might not correspond to the configured one. If the CNAME flattening is enabled, the selected TLS configuration is the SNI one and the routing uses the CNAME value, so this can skip the expected TLS configuration. Version 2.6.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may add the FDQN to the host rule. However, there is no workaround if the CNAME flattening is enabled.
CVE-2022-23633	2022-02-11	rails	Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed. In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests.This has been fixed in Rails 7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, and 5.2.6.1. Upgrading is highly recommended, but to work around this problem a middleware described in GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9 can be used.
CVE-2022-23634	2022-02-11	puma	Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. Prior to `puma` version `5.6.2`, `puma` may not always call `close` on the response body. Rails, prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body being closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to work correctly. The combination of these two behaviors (Puma not closing the body + Rails' Executor implementation) causes information leakage. This problem is fixed in Puma versions 5.6.2 and 4.3.11. This problem is fixed in Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2. Upgrading to a patched Rails _or_ Puma version fixes the vulnerability.
CVE-2022-23635	2022-02-22	istio	Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In affected versions the Istio control plane, `istiod`, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15012, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [multicluster](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/primary-remote/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. Limiting network access to Istiod to the minimal set of clients can help lessen the scope of the vulnerability to some extent.
CVE-2022-23636	2022-02-16	wasmtime	Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. Prior to versions 0.34.1 and 0.33.1, there exists a bug in the pooling instance allocator in Wasmtime's runtime where a failure to instantiate an instance for a module that defines an `externref` global will result in an invalid drop of a `VMExternRef` via an uninitialized pointer. A number of conditions listed in the GitHub Security Advisory must be true in order for an instance to be vulnerable to this issue. Maintainers believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small because the usage of `externref` is still uncommon and without a resource limiter configured on the `Store`, which is not the default configuration, it is only possible to trigger the bug from an error returned by `mprotect` or `VirtualAlloc`. Note that on Linux with the `uffd` feature enabled, it is only possible to trigger the bug from a resource limiter as the call to `mprotect` is skipped. The bug has been fixed in 0.34.1 and 0.33.1 and users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. If it is not possible to upgrade to version 0.34.1 or 0.33.1 of the `wasmtime` crate, it is recommend that support for the reference types proposal be disabled by passing `false` to `Config::wasm_reference_types`. Doing so will prevent modules that use `externref` from being loaded entirely.
CVE-2022-23637	2022-02-14	k-box	K-Box is a web-based application to manage documents, images, videos and geodata. Prior to version 0.33.1, a stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in the markdown editor used by the document abstract and markdown file preview. A specifically crafted anchor link can, if clicked, execute untrusted javascript actions, like retrieving user cookies. Version 0.33.1 includes a patch that allows discarding unsafe links.
CVE-2022-23638	2022-02-14	svg-sanitizer	svg-sanitizer is a SVG/XML sanitizer written in PHP. A cross-site scripting vulnerability impacts all users of the `svg-sanitizer` library prior to version 0.15.0. This issue is fixed in version 0.15.0. There is currently no workaround available.
CVE-2022-23639	2022-02-15	crossbeam	crossbeam-utils provides atomics, synchronization primitives, scoped threads, and other utilities for concurrent programming in Rust. crossbeam-utils prior to version 0.8.7 incorrectly assumed that the alignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. However, the alignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{I,U}64`. This can cause unaligned memory accesses and data race. Crates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected by this issue. 32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets are not affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-23640	2022-03-02	excel-streaming-reader	Excel-Streaming-Reader is an easy-to-use implementation of a streaming Excel reader using Apache POI. Prior to xlsx-streamer 2.1.0, the XML parser that was used did apply all the necessary settings to prevent XML Entity Expansion issues. Upgrade to version 2.1.0 to receive a patch. There is no known workaround.
CVE-2022-23641	2022-02-15	discourse	Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 2.8.1 in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 in the `tests-passed` branch, users can trigger a Denial of Service attack by posting a streaming URL. Parsing Oneboxes in the background job trigger an infinite loop, which cause memory leaks. This issue is patched in version 2.8.1 of the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 of the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 of the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, disable onebox in admin panel completely or specify allow list of domains that will be oneboxed.
CVE-2022-23642	2022-02-18	sourcegraph	Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph prior to version 3.37 is vulnerable to remote code execution in the `gitserver` service. The service acts as a git exec proxy, and fails to properly restrict calling `git config`. This allows an attacker to set the git `core.sshCommand` option, which sets git to use the specified command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system. Exploitation of this vulnerability depends on how Sourcegraph is deployed. An attacker able to make HTTP requests to internal services like gitserver is able to exploit it. This issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.37. As a workaround, ensure that requests to gitserver are properly protected.
CVE-2022-23643	2022-02-15	sourcegraph	Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph versions 3.35 and 3.36 reintroduced a previously fixed side-channel vulnerabilitity in the Code Monitoring feature where strings in private source code could be guessed by an authenticated but unauthorized actor. This issue affects only the Code Monitoring feature, whereas CVE-2021-43823 also affected saved searches. A successful attack would require an authenticated bad actor to create many Code Monitors to receive confirmation that a specific string exists. This could allow an attacker to guess formatted tokens in source code, such as API keys. This issue was patched in versions 3.35.2 and 3.36.3 of Sourcegraph. Those who are unable to upgrade may disable the Code Monitor feature in their installation.
CVE-2022-23644	2022-02-16	bookwyrm	BookWyrm is a decentralized social network for tracking reading habits and reviewing books. The functionality to load a cover via url is vulnerable to a server-side request forgery attack. Any BookWyrm instance running a version prior to v0.3.0 is susceptible to attack from a logged-in user. The problem has been patched and administrators should upgrade to version 0.3.0 As a workaround, BookWyrm instances can close registration and limit members to trusted individuals.
CVE-2022-23645	2022-02-18	swtpm	swtpm is a libtpms-based TPM emulator with socket, character device, and Linux CUSE interface. Versions prior to 0.5.3, 0.6.2, and 0.7.1 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read. A specially crafted header of swtpm's state, where the blobheader's hdrsize indicator has an invalid value, may cause an out-of-bounds access when the byte array representing the state of the TPM is accessed. This will likely crash swtpm or prevent it from starting since the state cannot be understood. Users should upgrade to swtpm v0.5.3, v0.6.2, or v0.7.1 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-23646	2022-02-17	next.js	Next.js is a React framework. Starting with version 10.0.0 and prior to version 12.1.0, Next.js is vulnerable to User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information. In order to be affected, the `next.config.js` file must have an `images.domains` array assigned and the image host assigned in `images.domains` must allow user-provided SVG. If the `next.config.js` file has `images.loader` assigned to something other than default, the instance is not affected. Version 12.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, change `next.config.js` to use a different `loader configuration` other than the default.
CVE-2022-23647	2022-02-18	prism	Prism is a syntax highlighting library. Starting with version 1.14.0 and prior to version 1.27.0, Prism's command line plugin can be used by attackers to achieve a cross-site scripting attack. The command line plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text being inserted into the DOM as HTML code. Server-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the Command Line plugin are also not impacted. This bug has been fixed in v1.27.0. As a workaround, do not use the command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitize all code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use the command line plugin.
CVE-2022-23648	2022-03-03	containerd	containerd is a container runtime available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.14.12 where containers launched through containerd’s CRI implementation on Linux with a specially-crafted image configuration could gain access to read-only copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host. This may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd’s CRI implementation. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.
CVE-2022-23649	2022-02-18	cosign	Cosign provides container signing, verification, and storage in an OCI registry for the sigstore project. Prior to version 1.5.2, Cosign can be manipulated to claim that an entry for a signature exists in the Rekor transparency log even if it doesn't. This requires the attacker to have pull and push permissions for the signature in OCI. This can happen with both standard signing with a keypair and "keyless signing" with Fulcio. If an attacker has access to the signature in OCI, they can manipulate cosign into believing the entry was stored in Rekor even though it wasn't. The vulnerability has been patched in v1.5.2 of Cosign. The `signature` in the `signedEntryTimestamp` provided by Rekor is now compared to the `signature` that is being verified. If these don't match, then an error is returned. If a valid bundle is copied to a different signature, verification should fail. Cosign output now only informs the user that certificates were verified if a certificate was in fact verified. There is currently no known workaround.
CVE-2022-23650	2022-02-18	netmaker	Netmaker is a platform for creating and managing virtual overlay networks using WireGuard. Prior to versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, and 010.0, there is a hard-coded cryptographic key in the code base which can be exploited to run admin commands on a remote server if the exploiter know the address and username of the admin. This effects the server (netmaker) component, and not clients. This has been patched in Netmaker v0.8.5, v0.9.4, and v0.10.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-23651	2022-02-23	b2-sdk-python	b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.
CVE-2022-23652	2022-02-22	capsule-proxy	capsule-proxy is a reverse proxy for Capsule Operator which provides multi-tenancy in Kubernetes. In versions prior to 0.2.1 an attacker with a proper authentication mechanism may use a malicious `Connection` header to start a privilege escalation attack towards the Kubernetes API Server. This vulnerability allows for an exploit of the `cluster-admin` Role bound to `capsule-proxy`. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-23653	2022-02-23	B2_Command_Line_Tool	B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.
CVE-2022-23654	2022-02-22	wiki	Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. In affected versions an authenticated user with write access on a restricted set of paths can update a page outside the allowed paths by specifying a different target page ID while keeping the path intact. The access control incorrectly check the path access against the user-provided values instead of the actual path associated to the page ID. Commit https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/411802ec2f654bb5ed1126c307575b81e2361c6b fixes this vulnerability by checking access control on the path associated with the page ID instead of the user-provided value. When the path is different than the current value, a second access control check is then performed on the user-provided path before the move operation.
CVE-2022-23655	2022-02-23	october	Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Affected versions of OctoberCMS did not validate gateway server signatures. As a result non-authoritative gateway servers may be used to exfiltrate user private keys. Users are advised to upgrade their installations to build 474 or v1.1.10. The only known workaround is to manually apply the patch (e3b455ad587282f0fbcb7763c6d9c3d000ca1e6a) which adds server signature validation.
CVE-2022-23656	2022-03-02	zulip	Zulip is an open source team chat app. The `main` development branch of Zulip Server from June 2021 and later is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability on the recent topics page. An attacker could maliciously craft a full name for their account and send messages to a topic with several participants; a victim who then opens an overflow tooltip including this full name on the recent topics page could trigger execution of JavaScript code controlled by the attacker. Users running a Zulip server from the main branch should upgrade from main (2022-03-01 or later) again to deploy this fix.
CVE-2022-23701	2022-02-24	HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4)	A potential remote host header injection security vulnerability has been identified in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4) firmware version(s): Prior to 2.60. This vulnerability could be remotely exploited to allow an attacker to supply invalid input to the iLO 4 webserver, causing it to respond with a redirect to an attacker-controlled domain. HPE has provided a firmware update to resolve this vulnerability in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4).
CVE-2022-23707	2022-02-11	Kibana	An XSS vulnerability was found in Kibana index patterns. Using this vulnerability, an authenticated user with permissions to create index patterns can inject malicious javascript into the index pattern which could execute against other users
CVE-2022-23708	2022-03-03	elasticsearch	A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch 7.17.0’s upgrade assistant, in which upgrading from version 6.x to 7.x would disable the in-built protections on the security index, allowing authenticated users with “*” index permissions access to this index.
CVE-2022-23709	2022-03-03	kibana	A flaw was discovered in Kibana in which users with Read access to the Uptime feature could modify alerting rules. A user with this privilege would be able to create new alerting rules or overwrite existing ones. However, any new or modified rules would not be enabled, and a user with this privilege could not modify alerting connectors. This effectively means that Read users could disable existing alerting rules.
CVE-2022-23710	2022-03-03	kibana	A cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the Data Preview Pane (previously known as Index Pattern Preview Pane) which could allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in a victim’s browser.

CVE-2022-24666	2022-02-09	SwiftNIO HTTP2	A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 frame. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1. This vulnerability is caused by a logical error when parsing a HTTP/2 HEADERS frame where the frame contains priority information without any other data. This logical error caused confusion about the size of the frame, leading to a parsing error. This parsing error immediately crashes the entire process. Sending a HEADERS frame with HTTP/2 priority information does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to send an appropriately crafted frame. The impact on availability is high: receiving the frame immediately crashes the server, dropping all in-flight connections and causing the service to need to restart. It is straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly send appropriately crafted frames, so attackers require very few resources to achieve a substantial denial of service. The attack does not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself: swift-nio-http2 is parsing the frame in memory-safe code, so the crash is safe. However, sudden process crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it is possible that this attack can be used to trigger an error condition that has confidentiality or integrity risks. The risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented from communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to many services. The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to correctly handle the condition. The issue was found by automated fuzzing by oss-fuzz.
CVE-2022-24667	2022-02-09	SwiftNIO HTTP2	A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HPACK-encoded header block. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1. There are a number of implementation errors in the parsing of HPACK-encoded header blocks that allow maliciously crafted HPACK header blocks to cause crashes in processes using swift-nio-http2. Each of these crashes is triggered instead of an integer overflow. A malicious HPACK header block could be sent on any of the HPACK-carrying frames in a HTTP/2 connection (HEADERS and PUSH_PROMISE), at any position. Sending a HPACK header block does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send one. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to send an appropriately crafted field block. The impact on availability is high: receiving a frame carrying this field block immediately crashes the server, dropping all in-flight connections and causing the service to need to restart. It is straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly send appropriately crafted field blocks, so attackers require very few resources to achieve a substantial denial of service. The attack does not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself: swift-nio-http2 is parsing the field block in memory-safe code and the crash is triggered instead of an integer overflow. However, sudden process crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it is possible that this attack can be used to trigger an error condition that has confidentiality or integrity risks. The risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented from communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to many services. The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to correctly handle all conditions in the function. The principal issue was found by automated fuzzing by oss-fuzz, but several associated bugs in the same code were found by code audit and fixed at the same time
CVE-2022-24668	2022-02-09	SwiftNIO HTTP2	A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack caused by a network peer sending ALTSVC or ORIGIN frames. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1. This vulnerability is caused by a logical error after frame parsing but before frame handling. ORIGIN and ALTSVC frames are not currently supported by swift-nio-http2, and should be ignored. However, one code path that encounters them has a deliberate trap instead. This was left behind from the original development process and was never removed. Sending an ALTSVC or ORIGIN frame does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to send one of these frames. The impact on availability is high: receiving the frame immediately crashes the server, dropping all in-flight connections and causing the service to need to restart. It is straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly send these frames, so attackers require very few resources to achieve a substantial denial of service. The attack does not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself. This is a controlled, intentional crash. However, sudden process crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it is possible that this attack can be used to trigger an error condition that has confidentiality or integrity risks. The risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented from communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to many services. The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to correctly handle the condition. The issue was found by automated fuzzing by oss-fuzz.

CVE-2022-24694	2022-02-08	n/a	In Mahara 20.10 before 20.10.4, 21.04 before 21.04.3, and 21.10 before 21.10.1, the names of folders in the Files area can be seen by a person not owning the folders. (Only folder names are affected. Neither file names nor file contents are affected.)
CVE-2022-24696	2022-03-13	n/a	Mirametrix Glance before 5.1.1.42207 (released on 2018-08-30) allows a local attacker to elevate privileges. NOTE: this is unrelated to products from the glance.com and glance.net websites.
CVE-2022-24704	2022-02-14	Accel-PPP	The rad_packet_recv function in opt/src/accel-pppd/radius/packet.c suffers from a buffer overflow vulnerability, whereby user input len is copied into a fixed buffer &attr->val.integer without any bound checks. If the client connects to the server and sends a large radius packet, a buffer overflow vulnerability will be triggered.
CVE-2022-24705	2022-02-14	accel-ppp	The rad_packet_recv function in radius/packet.c suffers from a memcpy buffer overflow, resulting in an overly-large recvfrom into a fixed buffer that causes a buffer overflow and overwrites arbitrary memory. If the server connects with a malicious client, crafted client requests can remotely trigger this vulnerability.
CVE-2022-24707	2022-02-23	timetracker	Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in PHP. UNION SQL injection and time-based blind injection vulnerabilities existed in Time Tracker Puncher plugin in versions of anuko timetracker prior to 1.20.0.5642. This was happening because the Puncher plugin was reusing code from other places and was relying on an unsanitized date parameter in POST requests. Because the parameter was not checked, it was possible to craft POST requests with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database. This issue has been resolved in in version 1.20.0.5642. Users unable to upgrade are advised to add their own checks to input.
CVE-2022-24708	2022-02-23	timetracker	Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in PHP. ttUser.class.php in Time Tracker versions prior to 1.20.0.5646 was not escaping primary group name for display. Because of that, it was possible for a logged in user to modify primary group name with elements of JavaScript. Such script could then be executed in user browser on subsequent requests on pages where primary group name was displayed. This is vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.20.0.5646. Users who are unable to upgrade may modify ttUser.class.php to use an additional call to htmlspecialchars when printing group name.
CVE-2022-24709	2022-02-24	awsui-documentation	@awsui/components-react is the main AWS UI package which contains React components, with TypeScript definitions designed for user interface development. Multiple components in versions before 3.0.367 have been found to not properly neutralize user input and may allow for javascript injection. Users are advised to upgrade to version 3.0.367 or later. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-24710	2022-02-25	weblate	Weblate is a copyleft software web-based continuous localization system. Versions prior to 4.11 do not properly neutralize user input used in user name and language fields. Due to this improper neutralization it is possible to perform cross-site scripting via these fields. The issues were fixed in the 4.11 release. Users unable to upgrade are advised to add their own neutralize logic.
CVE-2022-24711	2022-02-28	CodeIgniter4	CodeIgniter4 is the 4.x branch of CodeIgniter, a PHP full-stack web framework. Prior to version 4.1.9, an improper input validation vulnerability allows attackers to execute CLI routes via HTTP request. Version 4.1.9 contains a patch. There are currently no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
CVE-2022-24712	2022-02-28	CodeIgniter4	CodeIgniter4 is the 4.x branch of CodeIgniter, a PHP full-stack web framework. A vulnerability in versions prior to 4.1.9 might allow remote attackers to bypass the CodeIgniter4 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.9. There are workarounds for this vulnerability, but users will still need to code as these after upgrading to v4.1.9. Otherwise, the CSRF protection may be bypassed. If auto-routing is enabled, check the request method in the controller method before processing. If auto-routing is disabled, either avoid using `$routes->add()` and instead use HTTP verbs in routes; or check the request method in the controller method before processing.
CVE-2022-24713	2022-03-08	regex	regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.
CVE-2022-24714	2022-03-08	icingaweb2	Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.
CVE-2022-24715	2022-03-08	icingaweb2	Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Authenticated users, with access to the configuration, can create SSH resource files in unintended directories, leading to the execution of arbitrary code. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2. Users unable to upgrade should limit access to the Icinga Web 2 configuration.
CVE-2022-24716	2022-03-08	icingaweb2	Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Unauthenticated users can leak the contents of files of the local system accessible to the web-server user, including `icingaweb2` configuration files with database credentials. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2. Database credentials should be rotated.
CVE-2022-24717	2022-03-01	ssr-pages	ssr-pages is an HTML page builder for the purpose of server-side rendering (SSR). In versions prior to 0.1.5, a cross site scripting (XSS) issue can occur when providing untrusted input to the `redirect.link` property as an argument to the `build(MessagePageOptions)` function. While there is no known workaround at this time, there is a patch in version 0.1.5.
CVE-2022-24718	2022-03-01	ssr-pages	ssr-pages is an HTML page builder for the purpose of server-side rendering (SSR). In versions prior to 0.1.4, a path traversal issue can occur when providing untrusted input to the `svg` property as an argument to the `build(MessagePageOptions)` function. While there is no known workaround at this time, there is a patch in version 0.1.4.
CVE-2022-24719	2022-03-01	fluture-node	Fluture-Node is a FP-style HTTP and streaming utils for Node based on Fluture. Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.
CVE-2022-24720	2022-03-01	image_processing	image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.
CVE-2022-24721	2022-03-15	cometd	CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.
CVE-2022-24722	2022-03-02	view_component	VIewComponent is a framework for building view components in Ruby on Rails. Versions prior to 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly sanitized before display. Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability. As a workaround, avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs before passing them.
CVE-2022-24723	2022-03-03	URI.js	URI.js is a Javascript URL mutation library. Before version 1.19.9, whitespace characters are not removed from the beginning of the protocol, so URLs are not parsed properly. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.9. Removing leading whitespace from values before passing them to URI.parse can be used as a workaround.
CVE-2022-24724	2022-03-03	cmark-gfm	cmark-gfm is GitHub's extended version of the C reference implementation of CommonMark. Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered.
CVE-2022-24725	2022-03-03	shescape	Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An issue in versions 1.4.0 to 1.5.1 allows for exposure of the home directory on Unix systems when using Bash with the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions from the _shescape_ API with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Other tested shells, Dash and Zsh, are not affected. Depending on how the output of _shescape_ is used, directory traversal may be possible in the application using _shescape_. The issue was patched in version 1.5.1. As a workaround, manually escape all instances of the tilde character (`~`) using `arg.replace(/~/g, "\\~")`.
CVE-2022-24726	2022-03-10	istio	Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In affected versions the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing when the validating webhook for a cluster is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [external istiod](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/external-controlplane/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.2, 1.12.5 and 1.11.8. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable access to a validating webhook that is exposed to the public internet or restrict the set of IP addresses that can query it to a set of known, trusted entities.
CVE-2022-24728	2022-03-16	ckeditor4	CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A vulnerability has been discovered in the core HTML processing module and may affect all plugins used by CKEditor 4 prior to version 4.18.0. The vulnerability allows someone to inject malformed HTML bypassing content sanitization, which could result in executing JavaScript code. This problem has been patched in version 4.18.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24729	2022-03-16	ckeditor4	CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. CKEditor4 prior to version 4.18.0 contains a vulnerability in the `dialog` plugin. The vulnerability allows abuse of a dialog input validator regular expression, which can cause a significant performance drop resulting in a browser tab freeze. A patch is available in version 4.18.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24730	2022-03-23	argo-cd	Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24731	2022-03-23	argo-cd	Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 1.5.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability, allowing a malicious user with read/write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `create` or `update` access to Applications can leak the contents of any text file on the repo-server. By crafting a malicious Helm chart and using it in an Application, the attacker can retrieve the sensitive file's contents either as part of the generated manifests or in an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from another Application's source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The problem can be mitigated by avoiding storing secrets in git, avoiding mounting secrets as files on the repo-server, avoiding decrypting secrets into files on the repo-server, and carefully limiting who can `create` or `update` Applications.
CVE-2022-24732	2022-03-09	maddy	Maddy Mail Server is an open source SMTP compatible email server. Versions of maddy prior to 0.5.4 do not implement password expiry or account expiry checking when authenticating using PAM. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should manually remove expired accounts via existing filtering mechanisms.
CVE-2022-24733	2022-03-14	Sylius	Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible for a page controlled by an attacker to load the website within an iframe. This will enable a clickjacking attack, in which the attacker's page overlays the target application's interface with a different interface provided by the attacker. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. A workaround is available. Every response from app should have an X-Frame-Options header set to: ``sameorigin``. To achieve that, add a new `subscriber` in the app.
CVE-2022-24734	2022-03-09	mybb	MyBB is a free and open source forum software. In affected versions the Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type `php` with PHP code, executed on on _Change Settings_ pages. This results in a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The vulnerable module requires Admin CP access with the `Can manage settings?` permission. MyBB's Settings module, which allows administrators to add, edit, and delete non-default settings, stores setting data in an options code string ($options_code; mybb_settings.optionscode database column) that identifies the setting type and its options, separated by a new line character (\n). In MyBB 1.2.0, support for setting type php was added, for which the remaining part of the options code is PHP code executed on Change Settings pages (reserved for plugins and internal use). MyBB 1.8.30 resolves this issue. There are no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24737	2022-03-07	httpie	HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client. HTTPie has the practical concept of sessions, which help users to persistently store some of the state that belongs to the outgoing requests and incoming responses on the disk for further usage. Before 3.1.0, HTTPie didn‘t distinguish between cookies and hosts they belonged. This behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookies when there are redirects originating from the actual host to a third party website. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24738	2022-03-07	evmos	Evmos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hub on the Cosmos Network. In versions of evmos prior to 2.0.1 attackers are able to drain unclaimed funds from user addresses. To do this an attacker must create a new chain which does not enforce signature verification and connects it to the target evmos instance. The attacker can use this joined chain to transfer unclaimed funds. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-24739	2022-03-08	alltube	alltube is an html front end for youtube-dl. On releases prior to 3.0.3, an attacker could craft a special HTML page to trigger either an open redirect attack or a Server-Side Request Forgery attack (depending on how AllTube is configured). The impact is mitigated by the fact the SSRF attack is only possible when the `stream` option is enabled in the configuration. (This option is disabled by default.) 3.0.3 contains a fix for this vulnerability.
CVE-2022-24740	2022-03-14	volto	Volto is a ReactJS-based frontend for the Plone Content Management System. Between versions 14.0.0-alpha.5 and 15.0.0-alpha.0, a user could have their authentication cookie replaced with an authentication cookie from another user, effectively giving them control of the other user's account and privileges. This occurs when using an outdated version of the `react-cookie` library and a server is under high load. A proof of concept does not currently exist, but it is possible for this issue to occur in the wild. The patch and fix is present in Volto 15.0.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, one may manually upgrade the `react-cookie` package to 4.1.1 and then override all Volto components that use this library.
CVE-2022-24741	2022-03-09	security-advisories	Nextcloud server is an open source, self hosted cloud style services platform. In affected versions an attacker can cause a denial of service by uploading specially crafted files which will cause the server to allocate too much memory / CPU. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 21.0.8 , 22.2.4 or 23.0.1. Users unable to upgrade should disable preview generation with the `'enable_previews'` config flag.
CVE-2022-24742	2022-03-14	Sylius	Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, any other user can view the data if browser tab remains unclosed after log out. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. A workaround is available. The application must strictly redirect to login page even browser back button is pressed. Another possibility is to set more strict cache policies for restricted content.
CVE-2022-24743	2022-03-14	Sylius	Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.10.11 and 1.11.2, the reset password token was not set to null after the password was changed. The same token could be used several times, which could result in leak of the existing token and unauthorized password change. The issue is fixed in versions 1.10.11 and 1.11.2. As a workaround, overwrite the `Sylius\Bundle\ApiBundle\CommandHandler\ResetPasswordHandler` class with code provided by the maintainers and register it in a container. More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
CVE-2022-24744	2022-03-09	platform	Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. In affected versions user sessions are not logged out if the password is reset via password recovery. This issue has been resolved in version 6.4.8.1. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin.
CVE-2022-24745	2022-03-09	platform	Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. In affected versions guest sessions are shared between customers when HTTP cache is enabled. This can lead to inconsistent experiences for guest users. Setups with Varnish are not affected by this issue. This issue has been resolved in version 6.4.8.2. Users unable to upgrade should disable the HTTP Cache.
CVE-2022-24746	2022-03-09	platform	Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. In affected versions it is possible to inject code via the voucher code form. This issue has been patched in version 6.4.8.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-24747	2022-03-09	platform	Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. Affected versions of shopware do no properly set sensitive HTTP headers to be non-cacheable. If there is an HTTP cache between the server and client then headers may be exposed via HTTP caches. This issue has been resolved in version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24748	2022-03-09	platform	Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. In versions prior to 6.4.8.2 it is possible to modify customers and to create orders without App Permission. This issue is a result of improper api route checking. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24749	2022-03-14	Sylius	Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. In versions prior to 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible to upload an SVG file containing cross-site scripting (XSS) code in the admin panel. In order to perform a XSS attack, the file itself has to be open in a new card or loaded outside of the IMG tag. The problem applies both to the files opened on the admin panel and shop pages. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. As a workaround, require a library that adds on-upload file sanitization and overwrite the service before writing the file to the filesystem. The GitHub Security Advisory contains more specific information about the workaround.
CVE-2022-24750	2022-03-10	UltraVNC	UltraVNC is a free and open source remote pc access software. A vulnerability has been found in versions prior to 1.3.8.0 in which the DSM plugin module, which allows a local authenticated user to achieve local privilege escalation (LPE) on a vulnerable system. The vulnerability has been fixed to allow loading of plugins from the installed directory. Affected users should upgrade their UltraVNC to 1.3.8.0. Users unable to upgrade should not install and run UltraVNC server as a service. It is advisable to create a scheduled task on a low privilege account to launch WinVNC.exe instead. There are no known workarounds if wincnc needs to be started as a service.
CVE-2022-24751	2022-03-16	zulip	Zulip is an open source group chat application. Starting with version 4.0 and prior to version 4.11, Zulip is vulnerable to a race condition during account deactivation, where a simultaneous access by the user being deactivated may, in rare cases, allow continued access by the deactivated user. A patch is available in version 4.11 on the 4.x branch and version 5.0-rc1 on the 5.x branch. Upgrading to a fixed version will, as a side effect, deactivate any cached sessions that may have been leaked through this bug. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24752	2022-03-15	SyliusGridBundle	SyliusGridBundle is a package of generic data grids for Symfony applications. Prior to versions 1.10.1 and 1.11-rc2, values added at the end of query sorting were passed directly to the database. The maintainers do not know if this could lead to direct SQL injections but took steps to remediate the vulnerability. The issue is fixed in versions 1.10.1 and 1.11-rc2. As a workaround, overwrite the`Sylius\Component\Grid\Sorting\Sorter.php` class and register it in the container. More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
CVE-2022-24753	2022-03-09	stripe-cli	Stripe CLI is a command-line tool for the Stripe eCommerce platform. A vulnerability in Stripe CLI exists on Windows when certain commands are run in a directory where an attacker has planted files. The commands are `stripe login`, `stripe config -e`, `stripe community`, and `stripe open`. MacOS and Linux are unaffected. An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability can run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. The update addresses the vulnerability by throwing an error in these situations before the code can run.Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.7.13. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-24754	2022-03-11	pjproject	PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language. In versions prior to and including 2.12 PJSIP there is a stack-buffer overflow vulnerability which only impacts PJSIP users who accept hashed digest credentials (credentials with data_type `PJSIP_CRED_DATA_DIGEST`). This issue has been patched in the master branch of the PJSIP repository and will be included with the next release. Users unable to upgrade need to check that the hashed digest data length must be equal to `PJSIP_MD5STRLEN` before passing to PJSIP.
CVE-2022-24755	2022-03-15	bareos	Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of data for operating systems. When Bareos Director >= 18.2 >= 18.2 but prior to 21.1.0, 20.0.6, and 19.2.12 is built and configured for PAM authentication, it will skip authorization checks completely. Expired accounts and accounts with expired passwords can still login. This problem will affect users that have PAM enabled. Currently there is no authorization (e.g. check for expired or disabled accounts), but only plain authentication (i.e. check if username and password match). Bareos Director versions 21.1.0, 20.0.6 and 19.2.12 implement the authorization check that was previously missing. The only workaround is to make sure that authentication fails if the user is not authorized.
CVE-2022-24756	2022-03-15	bareos	Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of data for operating systems. When Bareos Director >= 18.2 but prior to 21.1.0, 20.0.6, and 19.2.12 is built and configured for PAM authentication, a failed PAM authentication will leak a small amount of memory. An attacker that is able to use the PAM Console (i.e. by knowing the shared secret or via the WebUI) can flood the Director with failing login attempts which will eventually lead to an out-of-memory condition in which the Director will not work anymore. Bareos Director versions 21.1.0, 20.0.6 and 19.2.12 contain a Bugfix for this problem. Users who are unable to upgrade may disable PAM authentication as a workaround.
CVE-2022-24757	2022-03-23	jupyter_server	The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications. Prior to version 1.15.4, unauthorized actors can access sensitive information from server logs. Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other header values are recorded in Jupyter Server logs by default. Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access to the Jupyter server. Jupyter Server version 1.15.4 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24759	2022-03-17	js-libp2p-noise	`@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24760	2022-03-11	parse-server	Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm.
CVE-2022-24761	2022-03-17	waitress	Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int()` to parse strings into integers, leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead.
CVE-2022-24762	2022-03-14	sysend.js	sysend.js is a library that allows a user to send messages between pages that are open in the same browser. Users that use cross-origin communication may have their communications intercepted. Impact is limited by the communication occurring in the same browser. This issue has been patched in sysend.js version 1.10.0. The only currently known workaround is to avoid sending communications that a user does not want to have intercepted via sysend messages.
CVE-2022-24764	2022-03-22	pjproject	PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. Versions 2.12 and prior contain a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that affects PJSUA2 users or users that call the API `pjmedia_sdp_print(), pjmedia_sdp_media_print()`. Applications that do not use PJSUA2 and do not directly call `pjmedia_sdp_print()` or `pjmedia_sdp_media_print()` should not be affected. A patch is available on the `master` branch of the `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24766	2022-03-21	mitmproxy	mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24768	2022-03-23	argo-cd	Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue. To perform exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid privilege escalation, limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit which repositories are available in projects where users have `update` access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering, limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications.
CVE-2022-24769	2022-03-24	moby	Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.
CVE-2022-24770	2022-03-17	gradio	`gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.
CVE-2022-24771	2022-03-18	forge	Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can allow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and uses unchecked portion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature when a low public exponent is being used. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24772	2022-03-18	forge	Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code does not check for tailing garbage bytes after decoding a `DigestInfo` ASN.1 structure. This can allow padding bytes to be removed and garbage data added to forge a signature when a low public exponent is being used. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24773	2022-03-18	forge	Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code does not properly check `DigestInfo` for a proper ASN.1 structure. This can lead to successful verification with signatures that contain invalid structures but a valid digest. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24774	2022-03-22	cyclonedx-bom-repo-server	CycloneDX BOM Repository Server is a bill of materials (BOM) repository server for distributing CycloneDX BOMs. CycloneDX BOM Repository Server before version 2.0.1 has an improper input validation vulnerability leading to path traversal. A malicious user may potentially exploit this vulnerability to create arbitrary directories or a denial of service by deleting arbitrary directories. The vulnerability is resolved in version 2.0.1. The vulnerability is not exploitable with the default configuration with the post and delete methods disabled. This can be configured by modifying the `appsettings.json` file, or alternatively, setting the environment variables `ALLOWEDMETHODS__POST` and `ALLOWEDMETHODS__DELETE` to `false`.
CVE-2022-24775	2022-03-21	psr7	guzzlehttp/psr7 is a PSR-7 HTTP message library. Versions prior to 1.8.4 and 2.1.1 are vulnerable to improper header parsing. An attacker could sneak in a new line character and pass untrusted values. The issue is patched in 1.8.4 and 2.1.1. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24776	2022-03-24	Flask-AppBuilder	Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of the Flask web framework.

There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24777	2022-03-25	grpc-swift	grpc-swift is the Swift language implementation of gRPC, a remote procedure call (RPC) framework. Prior to version 1.7.2, a grpc-swift server is vulnerable to a denial of service attack via a reachable assertion. This is due to incorrect logic when handling GOAWAY frames. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to construct and send the required sequence of frames. The impact on availability is high as the server will crash, dropping all in flight connections and requests. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.2. There are currently no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-24778	2022-03-25	imgcrypt	The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.
CVE-2022-24781	2022-03-24	Geon	Geon is a board game based on solving questions about the Pythagorean Theorem. Malicious users can obtain the uuid from other users, spoof that uuid through the browser console and become co-owners of the target session. This issue is patched in version 1.1.0. No known workaround exists.
CVE-2022-24782	2022-03-24	discourse	Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions 2.8.2 and prior in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta3 and prior in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta3 and prior in the `tests-passed` branch are vulnerable to a data leak. Users can request an export of their own activity. Sometimes, due to category settings, they may have category membership for a secure category. The name of this secure category is shown to the user in the export. The same thing occurs when the user's post has been moved to a secure category. A patch for this issue is available in the `main` branch of Discourse's GitHub repository and is anticipated to be part of future releases.
CVE-2022-24783	2022-03-25	deno	Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. The versions of Deno between release 1.18.0 and 1.20.2 (inclusive) are vulnerable to an attack where a malicious actor controlling the code executed in a Deno runtime could bypass all permission checks and execute arbitrary shell code. This vulnerability does not affect users of Deno Deploy. The vulnerability has been patched in Deno 1.20.3. There is no workaround. All users are recommended to upgrade to 1.20.3 immediately.
CVE-2022-24784	2022-03-25	cms	Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. Before versions 3.2.39 and 3.3.2, it is possible to confirm a single character of a user's password hash using a specially crafted regular expression filter in the users endpoint of the REST API. Multiple such requests can eventually uncover the entire hash. The hash is not present in the response, however the presence or absence of a result confirms if the character is in the right position. The API has throttling enabled by default, making this a time intensive task. Both the REST API and the users endpoint need to be enabled, as they are disabled by default. The issue has been fixed in versions 3.2.39 and above, and 3.3.2 and above.
CVE-2022-24789	2022-03-28	C1-CMS-Foundation	C1 CMS is an open-source, .NET based Content Management System (CMS). Versions prior to 6.12 allow an authenticated user to exploit Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) by causing the server to make arbitrary GET requests to other servers in the local network or on localhost. The attacker may also truncate arbitrary files to zero size (effectively delete them) leading to denial of service (DoS) or altering application logic. The authenticated user may unknowingly perform the actions by visiting a specially crafted site. Patched in C1 CMS v6.12, no known workarounds exist.
CVE-2022-24915	2022-03-09	IPCOMM ipDIO 	The absence of filters when loading some sections in the web application of the vulnerable device allows attackers to inject malicious code that will be interpreted when a legitimate user accesses the web section where the information is displayed.

CVE-2022-25213	2022-03-07	Phicomm Routers	Improper physical access control and use of hard-coded credentials in /etc/passwd permits an attacker with physical access to obtain a root shell via an unprotected UART port on the device. The same port exposes an unauthenticated Das U-Boot BIOS shell.
CVE-2022-25214	2022-03-07	Phicomm Routers	Improper access control on the LocalClientList.asp interface allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to obtain sensitive information concerning devices on the local area network, including IP and MAC addresses. Improper access control on the wirelesssetup.asp interface allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to obtain the WPA passphrases for the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz wireless networks. This is particularly dangerous given that the K2G setup wizard presents the user with the option of using the same password for the 2.4Ghz network and the administrative interface, by clicking a checkbox. When Remote Managment is enabled, these endpoints are exposed to the WAN.
CVE-2022-25215	2022-03-07	Phicomm Routers	Improper access control on the LocalMACConfig.asp interface allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to add (or remove) client MAC addresses to (or from) a list of banned hosts.

CVE-2022-25216	2022-03-11	DVDFab 12 Player / PlayerFab	An absolute path traversal vulnerability allows a remote attacker to download any file on the Windows file system for which the user account running DVDFab 12 Player (recently renamed PlayerFab) has read-access, by means of an HTTP GET request to http://<IP_ADDRESS>:32080/download/<URL_ENCODED_PATH>.
CVE-2022-25217	2022-03-07	Phicomm Routers	Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key pair by the telnetd_startup service allows an attacker on the local area network to obtain a root shell on the device over telnet. The builds of telnetd_startup included in the version 22.5.9.163 of the K2 firmware, and version 32.1.15.93 of the K3C firmware (possibly amongst many other releases) included both the private and public RSA keys. The remaining versions cited here redacted the private key, but left the public key unchanged. An attacker in possession of the leaked private key may, through a scripted exchange of UDP packets, instruct telnetd_startup to spawn an unauthenticated telnet shell as root, by means of which they can then obtain complete control of the device. A consequence of the limited availablility of firmware images for testing is that models and versions not listed here may share this vulnerability.
CVE-2022-25218	2022-03-07	Phicomm Routers	The use of the RSA algorithm without OAEP, or any other padding scheme, in telnetd_startup, allows an unauthenticated attacker on the local area network to achieve a significant degree of control over the "plaintext" to which an arbitrary blob of ciphertext will be decrypted by OpenSSL's RSA_public_decrypt() function. This weakness allows the attacker to manipulate the various iterations of the telnetd startup state machine and eventually obtain a root shell on the device, by means of an exchange of crafted UDP packets. In all versions but K2 22.5.9.163 and K3C 32.1.15.93 a successful attack also requires the exploitation of a null-byte interaction error (CVE-2022-25219).
CVE-2022-25219	2022-03-07	Phicomm Routers	A null byte interaction error has been discovered in the code that the telnetd_startup daemon uses to construct a pair of ephemeral passwords that allow a user to spawn a telnet service on the router, and to ensure that the telnet service persists upon reboot. By means of a crafted exchange of UDP packets, an unauthenticated attacker on the local network can leverage this null byte interaction error in such a way as to make those ephemeral passwords predictable (with 1-in-94 odds). Since the attacker must manipulate data processed by the OpenSSL function RSA_public_decrypt(), successful exploitation of this vulnerability depends on the use of an unpadded RSA cipher (CVE-2022-25218).
